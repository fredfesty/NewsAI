            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>On the evening of 4 October 2025, a one-year-old pet lioness belonging to a social media influencer escaped its enclosure in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, and attacked two individuals, including an 11-year-old boy. The incident has resulted in the seizure of the animal by wildlife authorities and legal action against the owner. This event has cast a harsh spotlight on the growing trend of keeping exotic animals as pets in Thailand, prompting a critical examination of the existing legal framework, the role of social media in popularising such practices, and the inherent risks to public safety and animal welfare. The case of the Kanchanaburi lioness serves as a potent case study for the multifaceted challenges posed by the private ownership of dangerous wildlife, igniting a national debate on the adequacy of current regulations and the ethical implications of treating wild animals as domestic companions.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The tranquil province of Kanchanaburi, situated in western Thailand, became the epicentre of a national controversy in early October 2025. A story emerged that was both sensational and deeply troubling: a pet lioness, owned by a local social media personality, had broken free from its restraints and attacked two people. This was not a tale from a distant savanna, but a stark reality unfolding in a residential community. The incident, which left an 11-year-old boy and a 43-year-old man with injuries, has ignited a fierce debate across Thailand about the wisdom and legality of keeping such formidable predators in domestic settings. The allure of exotic pets, amplified by the curated realities of social media, has collided with the untameable nature of wild animals, raising profound questions about public safety, animal welfare, and the responsibilities of ownership in the 21st century.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Attack in Kanchanaburi</h3>
            <p>On the evening of Saturday, 4 October 2025, in the Bo Phloi District of Kanchanaburi, the ordinary rhythm of village life was shattered. At approximately 8:45 PM, a one-year-old lioness named Mahesi, meaning 'queen consort' in Thai, escaped from the property of its owner, 32-year-old social media influencer Parinya Parkpoom. Mr. Parkpoom had reportedly tethered the animal to a pole in his house while its cage was undergoing renovations. The chain, however, proved insufficient to restrain the young but powerful predator.</p>
            <p>The lioness, now free, encountered 11-year-old Arthit Nueangnui, who was reportedly running past the influencer's house. The animal attacked the boy, biting and clawing his hip. A neighbour, 43-year-old Sarawut Tokaeo, heard the boy's screams and rushed to his aid, sustaining injuries to his chest, thigh, and left arm in the process. The commotion drew the attention of other villagers, whose loud cries are credited with startling the lioness and preventing a more tragic outcome.</p>
            <p>Both victims were promptly transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. Arthit Nueangnui's injuries to his right hip were described as serious, while Sarawut Tokaeo required stitches for his wounds. Both were later reported to be in a stable condition and have since been discharged.</p>
            <p>The owner, Parinya Parkpoom, who has a significant following on social media platforms where he often posted content featuring his exotic pets, was alerted to the attack by his neighbours. He subsequently managed to recapture the lioness and secure it. In the aftermath, Mr. Parkpoom expressed his remorse, accepting full responsibility for the incident and pledging to cover all medical expenses for the injured parties. He attributed the escape to his own negligence. However, this was not the first time the lioness had escaped, with one witness claiming it was the third such occurrence in the past year, a fact that has heightened local residents' safety concerns.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Official Response and Legal Ramifications</h3>
            <p>The incident swiftly drew the attention of national authorities. Thailand's Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Suchart Chomklin, ordered immediate action. The Director-General of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP), Attapol Charoenchansa, instructed officials to launch a full prosecution against Mr. Parkpoom and to seize the lioness.</p>
            <p>Wildlife officials visited Mr. Parkpoom's residence, sedated the lioness, and prepared it for transfer to a government-run wildlife care centre in Suphan Buri. The owner has been charged under Article 15 of the Wildlife Conservation and Protection Act, which prohibits the abandonment or release of wild animals under an individual's care. This offence carries a potential penalty of up to six months in prison, a fine of up to 50,000 baht (approximately Â£1,148), or both. The DNP has also mandated that the owner will be responsible for all costs associated with the lioness's future care and feeding.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Legal Landscape of Exotic Pet Ownership in Thailand</h3>
            <p>The Kanchanaburi attack has brought the legal framework governing the ownership of exotic animals in Thailand into sharp focus. While it may seem surprising to some, owning lions is legal in the country, provided the owner complies with specific regulations. Since October 2022, exotic animals, including lions, can be legally owned if they are registered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and owners adhere to the Wildlife Protection Act.</p>
            <p>Lions are classified as a Type C controlled wildlife species, a designation for animals with fierce temperaments that could pose a danger to human life and property, thus requiring secure housing. The law mandates that individuals wishing to own such animals must obtain permits from the DNP. These permits are contingent on the owner's ability to provide adequate living conditions that meet animal welfare standards and, crucially, guarantee public safety. Furthermore, since 2022, owners are required to microchip their lions and inform the authorities before moving them.</p>
            <p>Despite these regulations, critics argue that there are significant loopholes and a lack of stringent enforcement. For instance, while the birth of protected native species like tigers must be reported within 24 hours, lion owners have a 60-day window, a period during which illicit activities could potentially occur. There is also a notable absence of specific requirements for enclosure standards and no caps on breeding. This regulatory ambiguity has contributed to a burgeoning captive lion population in Thailand. As of early 2024, official records indicated that 223 lions were registered to 37 entities, including private individuals and zoos. By mid-2025, this number had reportedly risen to nearly 500.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Influence of Social Media and the Normalisation of Danger</h3>
            <p>The role of social media in this incident cannot be overstated. The owner of the Kanchanaburi lioness is a social media influencer who had built a following by sharing content about his life with exotic animals. This is part of a broader trend where the online display of exotic pets can normalise and even glamorise their ownership, often downplaying the inherent dangers and complex welfare needs of these animals.</p>
            <p>Influencers who post videos and images of themselves playing with lion cubs or other predators can create a misleading perception that these animals are akin to domestic dogs or cats. This portrayal often masks the reality that as these animals mature, their wild instincts become more pronounced and their potential for causing serious harm increases exponentially. The Kanchanaburi incident serves as a stark reminder that a lion, no matter how it is raised, remains a wild animal with predatory instincts.</p>
            <p>The growth of the exotic pet industry in Thailand has been linked to the rise of online marketplaces and social media groups where such animals are bought and sold. A survey by WWF Thailand revealed that 51 per cent of exotic pet owners cited the rarity of the animal as a primary motivation for their purchase, and half of these transactions occurred online. This digital marketplace often operates with limited regulation, further facilitating the trade in potentially dangerous animals.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Broader Implications for Animal Welfare and Public Safety</h3>
            <p>The private ownership of large predators like lions raises significant animal welfare concerns. A residential home, regardless of the owner's intentions or affluence, cannot replicate the complex social and environmental conditions of a lion's natural habitat. Confining such animals to cages that are often inadequate can lead to stress, boredom, and abnormal behaviours. The online criticism of the seemingly substandard enclosure at Mr. Parkpoom's home highlights public concern over the welfare of these captive animals.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the incident underscores the grave risk to public safety. The escape of a lioness into a residential area is a scenario fraught with peril. The fact that this was reportedly the third such escape from the same property suggests a pattern of inadequate containment, placing the local community at repeated risk. This case is not an isolated one. In January 2024, a lion cub was seen in the back of a convertible in Pattaya, and another was found wandering in a residential area in Chon Buri, leading to charges against the owners. These events collectively point to a worrying trend that authorities are now under pressure to address more forcefully.</p>
            <p>The DNP has acknowledged the growing problem and has expressed its intention to propose changes to the law to tighten regulations on the ownership of dangerous wild animals. The department has urged those who keep wild animals to be acutely aware of the potential dangers, stating that any incident affecting the life and property of others will be met with the full force of the law.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The attack by a pet lioness in Kanchanaburi is a cautionary tale with far-reaching implications. It has exposed the inherent dangers of keeping wild animals as domestic pets, the inadequacies in the current legal framework, and the powerful role of social media in shaping trends that can have perilous consequences. The swift response from Thai authorities in seizing the animal and prosecuting the owner signals a growing recognition of the seriousness of this issue. However, this single incident is a symptom of a larger, more complex problem. As the number of captive lions and other exotic animals in private hands continues to rise, so too does the potential for future tragedies. The case of Mahesi the lioness serves as a critical juncture for Thailand, prompting a necessary and urgent re-evaluation of its relationship with wildlife and the laws that govern it. The outcome of this national conversation will determine not only the fate of hundreds of captive animals but also the safety and well-being of communities across the nation.</p>
