            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded with a decisive turn in American policy, moving away from the potential supply of long-range Tomahawk missiles and towards an immediate, brokered peace. The decision, which followed a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saw President Trump urge both warring nations to 'stop where they are' and 'Let both claim Victory,' signalling a new, uncertain phase for the conflict and for Kyiv's military leverage.</p>

           <h2>The White House Refusal</h2>
           <p>The meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>, was intended to be a crucial moment for Ukraine’s military prospects. Kyiv had been lobbying Washington for weeks<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> to secure the transfer of Tomahawk cruise missiles, a weapon Ukrainian officials considered a potential ‘game-changer’<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. However, the talks ended not with a commitment to new, powerful weaponry, but with a public call for an immediate cessation of hostilities<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. President Trump suggested that providing the Tomahawk missiles would be premature<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, stating that he hoped to secure peace with Russia first<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Speaking to journalists during the meeting, the US President expressed his preference: “Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over with without thinking about Tomahawks”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. He also voiced reservations about depleting the American arsenal, noting, “We want Tomahawks, also. We don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The shift in tone was stark, moving from a previous suggestion by the President that he might send the missiles if the war was not settled<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, to a clear reluctance to do so<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Following the talks, President Trump took to social media, posting on Truth Social that it was “time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL!”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. He proposed a freeze on the conflict along the current battle lines, writing: “They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This statement, which implied Ukraine would have to concede territory currently held by Russian forces<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, immediately reframed the US position from a guarantor of military support to an active, and potentially coercive, mediator<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Long-Range Calculus</h2>
           <p>The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a long-range, guided cruise missile<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> that has been a central request from Kyiv for months<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The weapon, first used in combat in 1991<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, is designed for deep-strike missions<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Modern conventional variants of the missile possess an operational range of approximately 995 miles, or 1,600 kilometres<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. This range is significantly greater than the 190 miles (300 kilometres) offered by the US-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, which was previously supplied to Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Tomahawk’s capability to fly low to the ground at high subsonic speeds<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> makes it particularly difficult for Russian air defence systems to detect and intercept<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Ukrainian military planners argued that the missiles would allow them to strike hundreds of Russian military targets<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> deep inside Russian territory<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. These targets include critical military bases, logistics hubs, airfields, and command centres<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> that have remained largely safe from Ukrainian long-range attacks<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The Institute for the Study of War estimated that a substantial number of Russian military locations would fall within the Tomahawk’s strike radius<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. For Kyiv, the acquisition of the Tomahawk was not merely about battlefield advantage; it was a strategic tool intended to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to take negotiations seriously<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy was frank about the necessity, telling President Trump, “We have drones. We don’t have Tomahawks. That’s why we need them”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The missiles, which cost an estimated $1.3 million (£1 million) each<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, are typically launched from ships and submarines<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. However, a land-launched variant, the Typhon, is available, though the launchers are in short supply<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The debate over the Tomahawk supply had already forced Moscow into dialogue with Washington<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, demonstrating the weapon’s diplomatic leverage even before its potential deployment<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Kremlin's Diplomatic Counter-Move</h2>
           <p>The White House meeting on Friday, 17 October<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, was immediately preceded by a lengthy phone call between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, 16 October<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The two leaders spoke for approximately two-and-a-half hours<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. This conversation, the eighth known call between the two men since President Trump’s return to office in January<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, was initiated by the Russian leader<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. During the call, President Putin reportedly warned his American counterpart against supplying the Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. According to Yuri Ushakov, a Russian foreign-policy advisor, President Putin stated that the transfer of the long-range weapons would not alter the situation on the battlefield<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> but would instead inflict “substantial damage to the relationship between our countries”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The Russian President’s intervention appeared to have an immediate and profound effect on the US position<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Up until the call, President Trump had been publicly suggesting he was seriously considering the transfer of the missiles<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Following the conversation, however, the US President’s tone shifted dramatically, moving away from military escalation and towards a diplomatic resolution<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The call also resulted in an agreement for a new, high-level summit between the two leaders<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. President Trump announced that he and President Putin would meet in Budapest, Hungary, within the next two weeks<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> to discuss ways to end the conflict<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The announcement of the summit, which was a significant diplomatic win for Moscow<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, was made while President Zelenskyy was en route to Washington<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The sequence of events—a warning from Moscow, a shift in US policy, and the immediate scheduling of a bilateral summit—suggested that President Putin had successfully used the threat of escalation to steer the US President toward a peace-brokering role favourable to the Kremlin<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Budapest Peace Track</h2>
           <p>The choice of Budapest, the capital of Hungary, as the venue for the upcoming Trump-Putin summit was a notable diplomatic development<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Hungary’s Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, is a close political ally of President Trump<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> and one of the few European leaders who has maintained close ties with President Putin since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. President Trump explained the choice of venue by praising Hungary and its Prime Minister, stating that both he and President Putin “like Viktor Orbán”<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. He described Hungary as a “safe country” and suggested that Mr Orbán would be a “very good host”<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Mr Orbán, a nationalist leader whom the European Union has accused of turning Hungary into an autocracy<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>, enthusiastically welcomed the announcement<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. He hailed the planned meeting as “great news for the peace-loving people of the world”<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> and declared on social media that Hungary was an “island of PEACE!”<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The Kremlin confirmed the plans for the meeting<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>, with President Putin detailing the content of his phone call with President Trump to Mr Orbán<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The two leaders agreed that their representatives, led on the US side by Secretary of State Marco Rubio<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, would hold initial high-level meetings the following week<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The proposed summit, which President Trump suggested could take place within two weeks<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, represents a significant diplomatic opportunity for Moscow, which has consistently sought to engage directly with Washington while bypassing Kyiv<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The question of whether President Zelenskyy would be involved in the Budapest talks remained open, with President Trump suggesting a “double meeting” with the leaders of the warring countries was the most workable option<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Kyiv's New Reality</h2>
           <p>For President Zelenskyy, the outcome of the White House meeting presented a new and difficult reality<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The Ukrainian President had arrived in Washington with the primary objective of securing the Tomahawk missiles<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, which he believed were essential for a successful offensive against Russian targets<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. His attempt to sweeten the deal by offering a trade—advanced Ukrainian drones in exchange for the US cruise missiles—was met with a non-committal response from President Trump<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. President Trump acknowledged that Ukraine makes a “very good drone”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> but remained hesitant to commit to the Tomahawk transfer<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Following the meeting, President Zelenskyy adopted a measured public stance, telling reporters that he was “realistic” about the chances of securing the missiles<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. He noted that the US President had not said ‘no’ to the request, but had not said ‘yes’ either<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Ukrainian leader also stressed the necessity of strong security guarantees from the United States<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. He expressed the fear that a ceasefire without such guarantees would simply allow President Putin to ‘come again with aggression’<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Despite the setback on the weapons front, President Zelenskyy maintained that he was counting on President Trump to pressure President Putin to halt the invasion<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. He also appeared to endorse the US President’s call for a ceasefire, stating that President Trump was right that the combatants should ‘stop where we are, and then to speak’<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This statement, however, was made before he had seen the full social media post in which President Trump called for both sides to ‘claim Victory’<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Andrii Sybiha, attempted to frame the diplomatic flurry as a positive development, writing on X that the mere discussion of Tomahawk missiles had already forced President Putin back into dialogue with America<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The conclusion, he argued, was that ‘Strength can truly create momentum for peace’<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Anxious Allies and the European Front</h2>
           <p>The shift in US policy and the announcement of the Budapest summit were met with anxiety across Europe<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The prospect of a US-brokered peace deal, negotiated directly with Moscow and potentially without Kyiv’s full consent, raised concerns among NATO allies<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. European leaders, who have been the primary providers of military and financial aid to Ukraine alongside the United States, fear that a peace deal based on the current battle lines would reward Russian aggression and undermine the principle of territorial integrity<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Following his meeting with President Trump, President Zelenskyy held a ‘productive’ phone call with European leaders<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those who spoke with the Ukrainian President<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The European leaders reaffirmed their support for Kyiv<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> and agreed to continue working on a peace plan for Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. They also discussed options for increasing pressure on Moscow, including through sanctions and the use of frozen Russian state assets<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The European position remains focused on a peace that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>, a stance that appears to be at odds with President Trump’s call for a ‘stop where they are’ ceasefire<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The selection of Hungary as the summit venue further exacerbated European concerns<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Mr Orbán’s government has consistently opposed EU sanctions on Russia and has been accused of undermining the bloc’s unified stance on the war<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. His enthusiastic embrace of the Trump-Putin meeting underscored the deep divisions within the Western alliance regarding the path to ending the conflict<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The upcoming summit, therefore, is viewed not just as a negotiation between Washington and Moscow, but as a critical test of the cohesion and resolve of the entire Western coalition<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The White House meeting on 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> marked a definitive turning point in the United States’ approach to the war in Ukraine. The refusal to commit to the long-range Tomahawk missiles<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>, coupled with the immediate announcement of a summit with President Putin in Budapest<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, signalled a clear shift in US priorities<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Washington’s policy has moved from one of military escalation, aimed at strengthening Kyiv’s hand on the battlefield, to one of diplomatic coercion, focused on brokering an immediate ceasefire along the existing front lines<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This new posture, encapsulated by President Trump’s call for both sides to ‘claim Victory’<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, places immense pressure on President Zelenskyy to accept a peace deal that would likely involve territorial concessions<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. While Kyiv attempts to leverage the diplomatic momentum to secure essential security guarantees<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, the prospect of a US-Russia summit in a Moscow-friendly capital like Budapest<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> has created profound uncertainty for Ukraine and its European allies<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The focus has now irrevocably shifted from the delivery of powerful weapons to the negotiation of a frozen conflict, the terms of which will be determined by the diplomatic interplay between Washington and Moscow<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
