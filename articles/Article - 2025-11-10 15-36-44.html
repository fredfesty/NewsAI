            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>A powerful car explosion near the historic Red Fort in New Delhi on the evening of Monday, November 10, 2025, killed at least eight people and injured a dozen others, immediately plunging the Indian capital into a state of high alert. The blast, which occurred in a slow-moving Maruti Suzuki Eeco near the Red Fort Metro Station, is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency and the National Security Guard, with forensic evidence increasingly pointing toward a high-intensity improvised explosive device (IED) rather than an accident. The incident’s gravity is amplified by its timing, coming just hours after a massive cache of nearly 3,000 kilograms of suspected ammonium nitrate and arms was recovered from a Kashmiri academic’s residence in the nearby city of Faridabad. Authorities are probing a direct link between the two events, suggesting a potential, sophisticated terror plot targeting a major national symbol and signalling a worrying resurgence of 'white-collar' terrorism in the National Capital Region.</p>

           <h2>The Blast at Lal Qila’s Gate</h2>
           <p>The explosion ripped through the congested area near Gate No. 1 of the Red Fort Metro Station in Old Delhi at approximately 6:55 PM on Monday, November 10, 2025<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The blast originated from a slow-moving Maruti Suzuki Eeco car that had stopped at a red light, according to the Delhi Police Commissioner<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The detonation was described by witnesses as deafening, causing the ground to shake and shattering windows in nearby buildings up to 900 metres away<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. At least eight people were killed instantly, and initial reports indicated that a dozen others sustained injuries, with victims rushed to hospitals including Lok Nayak Hospital (LNJP)<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The force of the explosion immediately triggered a massive fire that engulfed the Eeco and spread rapidly to multiple nearby vehicles, including at least six cars, four motorcycles, and three e-rickshaws<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Seven fire tenders were dispatched to the scene, and the blaze was eventually brought under control by 7:36 PM<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The area, a bustling hub of commerce and transport opposite the Chandni Chowk market, was immediately cordoned off, and the Red Fort Metro Station temporarily restricted entry and exit<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The sheer scale of the damage and the rapid response from India’s premier anti-terror agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the National Security Guard (NSG), signalled that authorities were treating the incident as a high-priority security threat<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Target of National Significance</h2>
           <p>The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, is not merely a tourist attraction but a profound symbol of Indian sovereignty and history<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century, the fort served as the main residence for Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Its historical importance was cemented in the modern era when, on August 15, 1947, India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national flag above its Lahori Gate<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Since then, the Prime Minister of India has delivered the annual Independence Day address to the nation from the fort’s ramparts, making it a perennial target for groups seeking to undermine the Indian state<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The site was previously attacked on December 22, 2000, when two militants from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) opened fire, killing two soldiers and a civilian<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. That attack, which occurred during a period of attempted peace talks between India and Pakistan, demonstrated the symbolic value of the fort as a target<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The location of the 2025 explosion, near the metro station gate in a densely populated, high-traffic zone, suggests a deliberate attempt to maximise both casualties and psychological impact<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The immediate deployment of the NIA and NSG, and the subsequent high alert issued across major cities including Mumbai and in the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, underscored the government’s assessment of the threat<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Forensic Evidence and the Terror Link</h2>
           <p>Initial speculation from local police sources suggested the explosion might have been caused by a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) cylinder, as the Maruti Suzuki Eeco was a CNG-equipped vehicle<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. However, this theory was quickly challenged by the scale of the blast and the subsequent involvement of anti-terror specialists<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Forensic experts and intelligence officials indicated that the damage was far greater than what a typical low-order CNG cylinder explosion would cause<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Reports from the site confirmed that forensic teams recovered metal debris, wires, and explosive residue, which strongly suggested the use of a high-order improvised explosive device (IED)<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Delhi Police Special Cell immediately launched a massive manhunt and detained at least one suspect from North Delhi for questioning, believing the individual may have links to the exploded vehicle<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were briefed on the situation, highlighting the national security implications of the event<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Faridabad Connection and the White-Collar Cell</h2>
           <p>The most alarming development in the investigation was the potential link between the Red Fort explosion and a massive terror plot uncovered just hours earlier in the National Capital Region (NCR)<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. On the same day, police in Faridabad, Haryana, arrested a Kashmiri doctor, Dr. Muzammil Shakeel, and recovered an unprecedented cache of explosive materials and weaponry from two of his rented houses<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The initial recovery included approximately 360 kilograms of suspected ammonium nitrate, along with a carbine rifle, two automatic pistols, 84 live cartridges, and 20 battery-fitted timers<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. Subsequent searches at a second property linked to Dr. Shakeel, who was a teacher at a local university, yielded an additional 2,563 kilograms of suspected explosives, bringing the total haul to nearly 3,000 kilograms<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. Dr. Shakeel, a resident of Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir, was reportedly wanted in a case related to the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Srinagar<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. Security agencies are investigating the possibility that Dr. Shakeel was part of a sophisticated 'white-collar' terror ecosystem, using his professional status as a cover for a trans-regional conspiracy<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. While officials did not immediately confirm a direct operational link between the Faridabad explosives and the Red Fort blast, the simultaneous nature of the events and the high-intensity nature of the explosion led investigators to treat the two as potentially connected components of a larger, coordinated plot<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The deadly explosion near the Red Fort represents a significant escalation in the security challenges facing India’s capital, moving beyond isolated incidents to suggest a potential, coordinated terror network operating within the National Capital Region<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The immediate involvement of the NIA and NSG, coupled with the recovery of nearly three tonnes of explosives and the arrest of a suspected JeM-linked academic in a neighbouring city, paints a picture of a sophisticated, high-impact threat<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The investigation is now focused on determining the precise nature of the explosive used in the car and establishing the operational connection between the Red Fort blast and the Faridabad cell<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the enduring vulnerability of India’s most symbolic landmarks and the evolving tactics of militant groups who are increasingly leveraging educated professionals to execute complex, urban attacks<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The coming days of the investigation will be critical in determining the full scope of the conspiracy and whether the security apparatus can dismantle the network before any further attacks are attempted<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>.</p>
