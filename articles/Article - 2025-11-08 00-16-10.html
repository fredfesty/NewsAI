            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>A powerful late-season typhoon, named Kalmaegi, has carved a path of destruction across Southeast Asia, leaving a devastating human toll in its wake. The storm first unleashed unprecedented flooding and landslides in the central Philippines, overwhelming communities still recovering from a recent earthquake. As the Philippines grappled with a death toll rising into the hundreds and hundreds of thousands displaced, the typhoon crossed the South China Sea to strike Vietnam. It made landfall in central Vietnamese provinces already saturated by record-breaking rainfall, compounding an existing crisis. The combined impact has stretched emergency services to their limits in both nations. Now, as recovery efforts begin amidst the wreckage, a new and potentially more powerful storm is gathering strength in the Pacific, threatening to strike the Philippines in a matter of days. This looming threat of a second major disaster highlights the profound vulnerability of the region to increasingly intense weather events.</p>

        <section>
           <h2>A Late Season Fury</h2>
           <p>In the final days of October 2025, an area of convection began to coalesce over the Pacific Ocean<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. By 31 October, it had organised into a tropical depression<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Meteorological agencies watched as the system steadily gained strength in an environment highly favourable for intensification<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The Japan Meteorological Agency designated it a tropical storm on 1 November, assigning it the name Kalmaegi<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. As it tracked westwards, it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on 2 November, where the local weather bureau, PAGASA, gave it the name Tino<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The storm continued to strengthen, being upgraded to a severe tropical storm and then, on 3 November, to a typhoon<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Forecasters noted the potential for rapid intensification, with some scenarios not ruling out the possibility of it reaching super typhoon category<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. As it approached the Philippines, it was the twentieth tropical cyclone to enter the country's jurisdiction in 2025<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. PAGASA began issuing Tropical Cyclone Wind Signals on 2 November, initially for provinces in the Visayas and Mindanao<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. By 3 November, the warnings were escalated, with the highest alert, Signal No. 4, eventually being raised over several islands, indicating that winds between 118 and 184 kilometres per hour were expected within 12 hours<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The First Landfall</h2>
           <p>In the first hour of 4 November, Typhoon Kalmaegi made its initial landfall near the town of Silago in Southern Leyte, with maximum sustained winds of about 130 kilometres per hour<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This was just the beginning of its destructive journey across the central Philippines<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The typhoon made four subsequent landfalls that day: in Borbon, Cebu; Sagay, Negros Occidental; San Lorenzo, Guimaras; and finally, Iloilo City<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Each landfall, a brutal interaction with the terrain, chipped away at the storm's structure but also unleashed torrential rain and destructive winds across a wide swathe of the Visayas region<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The province of Cebu, a populous and economically significant island, found itself directly in the typhoon's path<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The island was already in a precarious state, still recovering from a magnitude 6.9 earthquake that had struck on 30 September, killing at least 79 people and displacing thousands whose homes had been damaged or destroyed<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Many of these displaced residents were in flimsy, temporary shelters when the warnings for Kalmaegi were raised<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The rains that fell were described as 1.5 times the amount that would typically fall in Cebu for the entire month of November, an event meteorologists termed a once-in-20-years occurrence<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The consequences were catastrophic. Rivers and waterways swelled, bursting their banks and sending floodwaters described as unprecedented through towns and cities<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The sheer volume and speed of the water engulfed residential communities, forcing desperate residents to climb onto their roofs to await rescue<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The deluge was powerful enough to sweep away cars, piling them on top of one another, and even dislodge and carry away massive shipping containers<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Nation in Calamity</h2>
           <p>The human cost of Kalmaegi's passage through the Philippines quickly became apparent and continued to climb in the days that followed. By 7 November, the official death toll had risen to at least 188, with another 127 to 135 people still reported as missing<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The majority of the fatalities were due to drowning in the flash floods that tore through Cebu<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The province alone recorded at least 139 deaths<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. In the town of Liloan, near Cebu City, residents witnessed cars stacked by the floodwaters and roofs torn from buildings as they began the grim task of digging out of the mud<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The typhoon's impact was felt by nearly two million people across the country<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. More than 560,000 people were displaced from their homes, with nearly 450,000 seeking refuge in emergency evacuation centres<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The disaster was compounded by a separate tragedy when a Philippine Air Force helicopter on a humanitarian mission to typhoon-battered provinces crashed in Agusan del Sur on 4 November, killing the six military personnel on board<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. In response to the escalating crisis, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared a state of national calamity on 6 November<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. This declaration allows for the faster disbursement of emergency funds and helps to control the prices of basic necessities<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The government stated that it had sufficient funds to manage the immediate response and was not yet making a formal call for foreign financial assistance<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. However, offers of support from the international community began to arrive. The United States pledged $1 million in immediate life-saving assistance<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, among others, expressed their readiness to help with recovery efforts<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. In a notable gesture of regional solidarity, Timor-Leste, the newest member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pledged to send 120 engineers and firefighters to assist in cleanup and rehabilitation<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Numerous non-governmental organisations, including Oxfam, Americares, and the Philippine Red Cross, mobilised their teams to deliver aid, facing immense challenges due to impassable roads and bridges<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Second Strike</h2>
           <p>After exiting the Philippines on 5 November, Kalmaegi tracked west-northwest across the South China Sea, regaining strength over the warm waters<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. It reached its peak intensity on 6 November, with maximum sustained winds of 183 kilometres per hour and gusts of up to 205 kilometres per hour<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Its next target was Vietnam, a country whose central provinces were already reeling from days of flooding caused by record-breaking rainfall that had claimed 47 lives<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Vietnamese authorities, bracing for the 13th storm to affect the country in 2025, issued urgent warnings and organised large-scale evacuations<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. More than 260,000 people were moved from vulnerable coastal communities in provinces such as Gia Lai and Quang Ngai<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Kalmaegi made landfall in central Vietnam on the afternoon of 6 November, lashing the region with fierce winds and torrential rain<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The storm was expected to dump more than 600 millimetres (24 inches) of additional rain in some areas, raising fears of further deadly landslides and flash floods<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. The impact was immediate and severe. By 7 November, authorities reported at least five people had been killed in Dak Lak and Gia Lai provinces, with several others injured or missing<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. Widespread damage was reported across the central region. At least 52 houses collapsed completely, and nearly 2,600 others were damaged or lost their roofs, the vast majority of them in Gia Lai province<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. The storm uprooted trees, downed power lines, and caused large-scale power outages that affected more than 1.6 million households<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>. As the storm weakened and moved inland towards Cambodia and Thailand, residents in coastal cities like Quy Nhon emerged to find streets littered with debris and corrugated metal roofing<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a>,<a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Dread of the Next Deluge</h2>
           <p>Even as the Philippines and Vietnam began to assess the full scale of the devastation, a new threat was already gathering in the east<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Weather agencies began tracking another tropical cyclone, designated Fung-wong, which was forecast to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility and be given the local name Uwan<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The forecasts were deeply alarming. Meteorologists predicted that Fung-wong would undergo rapid intensification, potentially reaching the status of a super typhoon by 8 or 9 November, with winds possibly exceeding 212 kilometres per hour<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>. The storm's projected path aimed it towards Northern or Central Luzon, with a potential landfall on 9 or 10 November<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The sheer size of the approaching storm was a major concern, with forecasters suggesting its diameter could swell to 1,400 kilometres, wide enough to affect almost the entire country<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The prospect of a second major disaster striking a nation with its emergency response capacity already stretched to the limit created a palpable sense of dread<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. President Marcos Jr. acknowledged the new threat during a briefing on the aftermath of Kalmaegi<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Humanitarian organisations like the Philippine Red Cross, already engaged in difficult relief operations in the Visayas, began preparing their teams in the north for another major impact<sup><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The back-to-back storms serve as a stark illustration of the region's vulnerability. Scientists have pointed to exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea as a key factor in Kalmaegi's power, a trend clearly linked to human-caused global warming<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup>. The increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events pose a formidable challenge to the resilience of communities caught in their path<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>Typhoon Kalmaegi has left an indelible scar on both the Philippines and Vietnam, a brutal reminder of the power of nature in a warming world. The storm, notable for its late-season intensity, did not just cause damage; it exploited existing vulnerabilities, striking a region in the Philippines still fragile from an earthquake and a part of Vietnam already saturated by floods<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The rising death toll, the vast numbers of displaced families, and the widespread destruction of homes and livelihoods represent a profound human tragedy<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The response has been massive, with national governments declaring states of calamity and mobilising resources, while the international community and aid organisations have stepped in to assist<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Yet, the recovery will be long and arduous. The most immediate challenge, however, is the storm that follows. The forecast of a potential super typhoon, Uwan, bearing down on the Philippines underscores a terrifying new reality for the region: the era of compound disasters, where there is no time to recover from one blow before the next one lands<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. The cycle of destruction and recovery is accelerating, testing the limits of human endurance and the capacity of governments to protect their citizens.</p>
