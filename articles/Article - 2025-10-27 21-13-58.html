            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>The mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from HMP Chelmsford triggered a nationwide manhunt and exposed deep-seated issues within the UK's prison and deportation systems. An independent inquiry has now been launched by Justice Secretary David Lammy to understand the critical failure that allowed Hadush Kebatu to walk free, placing intense scrutiny on the management of foreign national offenders and the state of a prison service under immense pressure.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Man Who Walked Free</h2>
           <p>On the morning of 24 October 2025, Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian national, was scheduled to be transferred from HMP Chelmsford to an immigration removal centre.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> Instead, due to what officials have described as 'human error', he was released into the community at 10:25 AM.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison in September for sexual offences, including the assault of a 14-year-old girl, and was due for deportation under the Early Removal Scheme (ERS) for foreign national offenders.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> The error was not realised until shortly after midday, by which time Kebatu had left the vicinity of the prison.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> He boarded a train to London, disembarking at Stratford just after 1:00 PM.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> This initiated a frantic two-day manhunt involving three police forces: Essex Police, the Metropolitan Police, and the British Transport Police.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> The search concluded at around 8:30 AM on 26 October, when Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area of London following a tip-off from a member of the public.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> Reports emerged that a confused Kebatu had attempted to return to the prison several times after his release, only to be turned away by staff.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Path to Offending</h2>
           <p>Hadush Kebatu, 38, had arrived in the UK on a small boat on 29 June 2025, having travelled through several countries.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> He was housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which was being used to accommodate asylum seekers.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> Just eight days after his arrival, on 7 July, he made sexually explicit comments to a 14-year-old girl and attempted to kiss her.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> The following day, he sexually assaulted a woman and again tried to kiss her, before encountering the same teenage girl and sexually assaulting her.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> The woman who had been assaulted saw the second incident and called the police, leading to his arrest.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> In September, Kebatu was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault, one count of attempted sexual assault, inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and harassment without violence.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> He was sentenced to 12 months in prison and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> His case had already drawn significant public attention, sparking protests and counter-protests outside the Bell Hotel.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>An Inquiry and Immediate Reforms</h2>
           <p>The political fallout from the mistaken release was immediate and severe.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup> Justice Secretary David Lammy announced the launch of an independent inquiry into the incident, describing himself as 'livid' on behalf of the victims and the public.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> He stated that the release was a 'mistake which should not have happened'.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The inquiry is to be chaired by Dame Lynne Owens, a former Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and Director General of the National Crime Agency.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> Its remit is to establish the full facts of the case, assess whether protocols were followed and if staff had sufficient resources, and make recommendations to prevent future errors.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> The report is expected within eight weeks.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> In the interim, Lammy announced immediate measures to tighten release procedures for foreign inmates.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> These include a new five-page checklist for governors, enhanced checks on prisoner details including tattoos and scars against photographs, and a requirement for a duty governor to be physically present for the release of any foreign national under the ERS.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> Furthermore, all releases from HMP Chelmsford under the ERS were suspended for the remainder of that week.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A System Under Strain</h2>
           <p>The erroneous release of Kebatu has cast a harsh light on the pressures within His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> The incident is not an isolated one; government figures published in July 2025 revealed that 262 prisoners had been released in error in the year to March 2025, a 128% increase from the 115 in the previous year.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> David Lammy noted that releases in error have been rising year on year since 2021, from an average of nine per month in 2023 to 17 per month between January and June 2024.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup> Charlie Taylor, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, described such mistakes as an 'endemic problem' and 'symptomatic of the chaos' within the system.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup> The Prison Officers' Association (POA) warned against scapegoating a single member of staff, noting that a custodial manager had been suspended even though more senior staff are involved in the multi-layered release verification process.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup> The union and prison governors have pointed to systemic issues, including a 30% cut in prison staffing under the previous government and the fact that more than half of frontline officers have less than five years' experience.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> The Prison Governors' Association stated that a 'checklist won't cut it' and called for reinvestment after years of austerity.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Politics of Blame</h2>
           <p>The political response was highly charged, with the government and opposition trading blame.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick labelled the incident a 'national embarrassment' and the 'Kebatu fiasco' as being of 'Labour's own making', dubbing the Justice Secretary 'calamity Lammy'.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> Jenrick highlighted the irony that Kebatu had seemingly tried to return to prison to be deported, claiming the government was stopping the 'only illegal migrants that actually want to leave the UK'.<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> Lammy, in turn, pointed to the legacy of the previous Conservative government, citing the reduction in prison staff and the increasing complexity and pressure on the system as contributing factors that make errors more likely.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The case also reignited debates about the management of foreign national offenders, who constitute around 12% of the total prison population.<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> The Early Removal Scheme, under which Kebatu was due to be deported, allows for the removal of foreign prisoners up to 18 months before their earliest release date to ease pressure on prisons.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The recapture of Hadush Kebatu brought a manhunt to a close, but it opened a period of intense scrutiny for the UK's justice system.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> The independent inquiry led by Dame Lynne Owens is tasked with providing answers not only for this specific failure but also for the alarming rise in erroneous releases across the prison estate.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> The incident has exposed the fragility of a system grappling with staff shortages, inexperience, and overcrowding.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> For the victims of Kebatu's crimes, the event was a source of significant stress and anxiety, and a feeling of being failed by the state.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> The father of the 14-year-old victim described the release as 'unbelievably irresponsible' and said his family felt 'massively let down'.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> As the inquiry proceeds, the questions it must address are fundamental: how to ensure such a dangerous error is not repeated, and how to restore public confidence in a critical public service that appears to be buckling under pressure.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> Kebatu is now expected to be deported to Ethiopia imminently, but the systemic vulnerabilities his case has laid bare will remain long after his departure.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup></p>
