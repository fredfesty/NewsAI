            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>The cancellation of the Tel Aviv derby between Maccabi and Hapoel on 19 October 2025, due to violent riots and the widespread use of pyrotechnics, represents a critical failure of public order and a new low point for Israeli football<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The decision by the Israel Police to call off the match at Bloomfield Stadium, citing a direct threat to human life, exposed the deep-seated socio-political fault lines that have long defined the rivalry<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. This event, which saw dozens of smoke grenades and flares thrown, injuring civilians and police officers, forces a national reckoning with the escalating problem of organised hooliganism and the failure of authorities to contain a conflict that has moved far beyond the confines of sport<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Night the Match Died</h2>
           <p>The atmosphere surrounding the Tel Aviv derby, known locally as the ‘Eternal Derby,’ is always charged, but the events of Sunday night, 19 October 2025, transcended the usual intensity of a major sporting fixture<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The match, scheduled to be played at the shared Bloomfield Stadium, was called off by the Israel Police just before the scheduled kick-off time<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The decision was unprecedented in its nature, being a pre-emptive cancellation due to disturbances that had already spiralled out of control inside and outside the venue<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Police officials stated that the conditions were unsafe to proceed, citing “disturbances and risks to human life”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The stadium, which has a capacity of approximately 29,400 spectators, was already filled with fans when the announcement was made<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The scene inside the ground was one of chaos, with the air thick with smoke from dozens of pyrotechnic devices<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Reports indicated that approximately 50 smoke grenades, flares, and fireworks were thrown onto the pitch and into the stands<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. This barrage of projectiles resulted in multiple casualties<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Israeli police confirmed that three of their officers were injured by pyrotechnic devices thrown directly at them, with one officer requiring hospital treatment<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Furthermore, between 12 and 13 civilians were injured, some of whom were evacuated for medical attention<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Among the injured was a 13-year-old boy<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Tel Aviv District police chief Haim Sargarof described the situation as “not a soccer game,” but rather a case of “serious disorder and violence”<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. He further asserted that the clashes were “planned ahead of time,” suggesting a level of premeditation among the ultra-fan groups<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. In the immediate aftermath, police forces arrested nine suspects and detained 16 others for questioning<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. A later police update reported that the total number of arrests had risen to 40 suspects, with 11 of those scheduled to be brought before a court<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The cancellation was confirmed by the Israel Professional Football Leagues Association approximately 20 minutes after the scheduled 8:30pm start time<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The decision drew mixed reactions from the clubs’ leadership<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Ben Mansford, the Chief Executive Officer of Maccabi Tel Aviv, stated that if the police could not ensure the security of the players, the decision to cancel was justified<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Conversely, Hapoel Tel Aviv CEO Guy Primor expressed frustration, questioning the precedent set by the cancellation and noting that previous matches had proceeded despite worse incidents<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The event forced the evacuation of an estimated 30,000 spectators from the stadium<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The police response outside the stadium was also marked by confrontation, with officers on horseback deployed to disperse Hapoel fans who refused to leave and were reportedly cursing at the police<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Eternal Divide</h2>
           <p>The rivalry between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv, which began with a friendly match on 25 February 1928, is one of the most enduring and politically charged in world football<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. It is a conflict that transcends mere sporting competition, acting as a proxy for the deep socio-political and ideological divisions that have shaped Israeli society since the pre-state era<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Maccabi Tel Aviv, founded in 1906, is historically associated with the middle-class, the secular establishment, and the Revisionist Zionism movement, which is generally considered right-wing<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The club’s identity is often seen as representing the economic and cultural heart of the city<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Hapoel Tel Aviv, established in 1923, was born out of the Histadrut, the General Organisation of Workers in the Land of Israel<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This foundation cemented its identity as the club of the working-class, the labour movement, and socialist or Marxist-leaning Jews<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The club’s logo historically featured a hammer and sickle, a clear symbol of its political and labour ties<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. While the socio-economic distinctions between the fan bases have blurred over the decades, the ideological fault line remains a powerful, often hostile, undercurrent<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The terraces of Bloomfield Stadium become a battleground where these historical narratives are re-enacted<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The rivalry is not just about points in the Israeli Premier League; it is a symbolic clash of worldviews<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The two clubs have met in the national league over 160 times since 1931, with Maccabi holding a slight lead in overall victories<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The intensity of the rivalry is such that it has influenced music, art, and community narratives within Israeli society<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The violence that erupted in 2025 is therefore not an isolated sporting incident but a manifestation of a broader, unresolved cultural schism<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>A History of Hostility and Precedent</h2>
           <p>The 2025 cancellation, while shocking in its pre-match timing, is not the first time the ‘Eternal Derby’ has been abandoned due to fan violence<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. A significant precedent occurred on 3 November 2014, when the match was abandoned after only 33 minutes of play<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. That incident was triggered by a pitch invasion where a Hapoel fan ran onto the field and physically attacked Maccabi midfielder Eran Zahavi<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Zahavi, who had previously played for Hapoel, had just scored an equalising penalty and was subsequently sent off for retaliating against his assailant<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The ensuing chaos saw more fans from both sides spill onto the pitch, leading to the match officials suspending and then officially abandoning the game<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Ten people were arrested in connection with the 2014 violence, which continued with brawling outside a city courthouse the following day<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Eyal Berkovic, the Hapoel manager at the time, famously described the day as a “black day” for Israeli football, lamenting that local soccer was “too much like war”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The 2000 Israel State Cup Final also saw a dark chapter in the rivalry, when hundreds of Maccabi fans stormed the pitch after Hapoel scored a late equaliser, resulting in attacks on Hapoel players and supporters<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. These historical flashpoints illustrate a pattern of escalating violence, often involving pitch invasions and direct confrontation with players and security personnel<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The 2025 incident, however, marked a shift from reactive abandonment to a proactive cancellation, indicating that the police assessed the threat level from pyrotechnics and planned disorder as too high to even begin the fixture<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Hooligan Element and International Scrutiny</h2>
           <p>The violence that led to the 2025 cancellation is inextricably linked to the rise of organised ultra-fan groups within Israeli football<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Maccabi Tel Aviv, in particular, has a long and turbulent history with its militant supporters, notably the ‘Commando’ faction<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. These groups, which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, introduced a new level of coordinated, often pre-arranged, violence, mirroring the hooligan firms of 1970s and 1980s Britain<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. For these factions, the rivalry with Hapoel is a symbolic battle for their entire worldview<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The problem of football violence in Israel has evolved over time<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Initially, violence was often incited by players on the pitch, but with the increasing commercialisation of the sport, the focus shifted to the crowd<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. More recently, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and issues of ethnicity and nationality have become major triggers for violent actions both inside and outside stadiums<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. A report by the New Israel Fund highlighted a significant increase in expressions of violence in Israeli football stadiums, with incidents rising by 18 per cent in the 2023/24 season, following a previous year that had already seen violence and racism reach a decade-high peak<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The cancellation of the derby came just days after Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were subjected to an international ban<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The Safety Advisory Group in Birmingham, England, which includes local stakeholders and West Midlands police, decided to prohibit Maccabi fans from attending a November Europa League match against Aston Villa<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The rationale for the ban was a high risk of violence based on “current intelligence and previous incidents”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. This decision followed a separate incident in November 2024, where Maccabi supporters were involved in clashes with Dutch youth in Amsterdam during a match against Ajax<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. During the Amsterdam incidents, Maccabi fans were filmed chanting anti-Arab slogans, tearing down Palestinian flags, and setting off flares<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The Birmingham ban, which drew condemnation from the Israeli government and even the UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, underscored the international perception of a serious and uncontained hooligan problem associated with the club<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The subsequent domestic cancellation only served to validate the security concerns raised by the British authorities<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Failure of Containment</h2>
           <p>The decision by the Israel Police to cancel the derby represents a profound failure of security and intelligence, despite the match being one of the highest-risk fixtures on the national calendar<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The police chief’s statement that the violence was ‘planned ahead of time’ suggests that the security apparatus was aware of the potential for disorder but was unable to prevent the entry and deployment of dozens of illegal pyrotechnic devices<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The use of flares and smoke grenades is a common feature of ultra-fan culture globally, but the sheer volume and the direct targeting of police officers and civilians with these devices, as reported by the authorities, elevated the incident from mere disorder to a public safety emergency<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The fact that 12 to 13 civilians and three police officers were injured before the match even began highlights the inadequacy of the pre-match security screening and crowd control measures<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The Bloomfield Stadium, which is the home ground for both Maccabi and Hapoel, is a modern venue, yet it has repeatedly been the site of major security breaches, including the 2014 pitch invasion<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The response from the Israel Football Association (IFA) and the Israel Professional Football Leagues Association (IPFLA) will now face intense scrutiny<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The cancellation of a major derby, particularly one with such deep cultural significance, carries significant financial and sporting consequences, including the potential for a technical victory to be awarded to one side, as suggested by Maccabi’s CEO<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Beyond the immediate fallout, the incident raises fundamental questions about the future of high-risk football fixtures in Israel<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The authorities face a difficult choice between imposing draconian measures, such as playing matches behind closed doors, or implementing a comprehensive, long-term strategy to address the root causes of the violence<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The latter would require tackling the organised nature of the ultra groups, enforcing stricter penalties for the use of pyrotechnics, and addressing the socio-political tensions that fuel the hostility on the terraces<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The events of 19 October 2025, serve as a stark reminder that the violence in Israeli football is not simply a matter of poor sportsmanship, but a reflection of deeper societal conflicts that are now spilling over into the public domain with dangerous consequences<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The cancellation of the Tel Aviv derby on 19 October 2025, due to a premeditated and violent riot, marks a watershed moment in the history of Israeli football<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. It was a day when the ‘Eternal Derby’ ceased to be a sporting contest and became a full-blown public safety crisis, resulting in multiple injuries and dozens of arrests<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The incident, fuelled by the deep-seated ideological schism between the Maccabi and Hapoel fan bases, underscored the failure of security measures to contain a problem that has been escalating for years<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Coming on the heels of an international ban on Maccabi supporters, the domestic cancellation confirms that the militant ultra-fan culture has reached a critical mass, posing a genuine threat to life and public order<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The path forward demands more than just disciplinary action against the clubs; it requires a national commitment to dismantle the organised hooligan factions and address the underlying socio-political tensions that transform a football stadium into a battlefield<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Until that is achieved, the shadow of violence will continue to loom over the Israeli Premier League, threatening to extinguish the passion of the game itself<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
