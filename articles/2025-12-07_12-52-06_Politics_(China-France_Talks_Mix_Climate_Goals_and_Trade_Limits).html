            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to Beijing in December 2025 was characterised by an extraordinary display of personal diplomacy from Chinese President Xi Jinping, including a rare joint trip to Chengdu. This high-level symbolism underscored China's strategy to cultivate Paris as a key partner within the European Union amidst rising geopolitical tensions. Despite the cordiality, the visit yielded few major commercial breakthroughs, with a long-anticipated Airbus order remaining unsigned and the French delegation expressing concern over the growing trade imbalance. The two nations did, however, issue significant joint statements on global governance, climate change, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, reaffirming their commitment to multilateralism and cooperation in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and the green economy. The discussions highlighted the persistent strategic friction, particularly over the war in Ukraine and China's call for France to maintain its 'strategic vision and independence' from the United States.</p>

           <h2>The Personal Touch of Statecraft</h2>
           <p>The state visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to the People's Republic of China in December 2025 was framed by an unusual degree of personal diplomacy, a deliberate choice by Beijing to elevate the bilateral relationship with Europe’s second-largest economy<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Chinese President Xi Jinping extended a rare courtesy by accompanying his French counterpart to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, a gesture seldom afforded to visiting foreign leaders outside of the capital<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. This symbolic display, which included strolls through a city park and visits to historic infrastructure sites, was widely interpreted as an effort to strengthen China’s diplomatic image and influence within the European Union<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The visit, Macron’s fourth state trip to the country, came at a moment of profound global turbulence, with economic fragmentation accelerating and unilateralism gaining new momentum<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. For Beijing, nurturing friendly ties with Paris serves as a potential avenue to influence the broader EU’s internal debates on trade and foreign policy<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The French delegation, which included a large contingent of top executives and ministers, signalled Paris’s intent to strengthen business and political ties despite rising trade tensions between China and Europe<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The French president’s schedule also included an appearance at Sichuan University, where he was welcomed enthusiastically by students who chanted his name in Chinese, ‘Makelong’<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. During his address, Macron cautioned the students against succumbing to the ‘sirens of division,’ referencing the faults in the world order and the division into geopolitical blocs<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Analysts suggested the high-profile international engagement also served a domestic purpose for Macron, allowing him to project global leadership following a challenging period in French domestic politics<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Unbalanced Ledger of Trade</h2>
           <p>The economic dimension of the visit was dominated by the persistent issue of the trade imbalance, a growing source of friction between Paris and Beijing<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. France’s trade deficit with China has been a mounting concern for the Macron administration, with the country being China’s seventh-largest trading partner<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The French president cautioned his counterpart that the accumulating imbalances were ‘not sustainable’ and carried the risk of triggering a financial crisis, urging a shift toward fairer, rules-based economic governance<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Despite the presence of top executives from major French companies, including Airbus, BNP Paribas, and Schneider Electric, the visit yielded limited concrete commercial results<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. A long-anticipated order for a package of up to 500 Airbus jets, a key expectation for the French delegation, was not signed<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Observers suggested that China’s leadership was unwilling to approve such a major industrial decision, as it would reduce Beijing’s leverage in ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, which is simultaneously pressing for new Boeing commitments<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. In total, the two leaders signed only 12 cooperation agreements, with no monetary value disclosed<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. These agreements covered a modest range of sectors, including population ageing, nuclear energy, and wildlife conservation, notably a promise for China to send two new giant pandas to France by 2027<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. France also sought to address China’s export controls on critical raw materials, which are essential for European car and semiconductor industries and put pressure on the entire European Union<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Both sides did agree to strengthen cooperation in traditional fields like aviation, aerospace, and civil nuclear energy, while also tapping into emerging areas such as the green economy, digital economy, biopharmaceuticals, and artificial intelligence<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. China’s Premier Li Qiang stated that Beijing was willing to import more high-quality French products and welcomed French enterprises, while simultaneously hoping France would provide a fair and stable business environment for Chinese companies<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Joint Stance on Climate and Nuclear Energy</h2>
           <p>One of the most substantive outcomes of the visit was the joint commitment to strengthen cooperation on global climate and environmental challenges<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The two nations issued a joint statement vowing to enhance their collective response to climate change, including accelerating efforts toward carbon neutrality and expanding collaboration on green technology<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. This commitment comes at a time when climate urgency demands concrete solutions, and cooperation between the two major economies is seen as a model for broader China-EU relations<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The joint statement outlined plans to enhance dialogue on complex topics such as carbon pricing, climate investment and financing, methane emissions, and methodologies for calculating carbon footprints<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Furthermore, the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a traditional area of Franco-Chinese cooperation<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. A joint declaration on civil nuclear cooperation emphasised the role of nuclear power as a clean and reliable source of baseload power for addressing climate change and energy security<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The agreement included sharing experience in the construction and operation of Generation III reactors, the life extension of existing plants, and the management of radioactive waste<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Both nations also committed to working together on new technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs), and to continue their participation in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) nuclear fusion project in southern France<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The cooperation in this sector is intended to support a ‘stable and resilient’ nuclear supply chain, including coordination on nuclear fuel supply and uranium resource security<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Geopolitical Fault Lines and Strategic Autonomy</h2>
           <p>The diplomatic discussions also addressed the most pressing geopolitical conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the situation in Palestine<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. On Ukraine, Macron pressed his Chinese counterpart to use Beijing’s influence to secure, at the very least, a ceasefire and a moratorium on strikes targeting critical infrastructure<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. While China and France issued a joint statement on the situation, Xi Jinping maintained Beijing’s long-stated position of working toward peace, having previously reaffirmed support for Russia<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Analysts noted that the Chinese leadership avoided offering any diplomatic breakthrough on the conflict, signalling the limits of bilateral influence on this core strategic issue<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The visit also served as a platform for China to subtly push its agenda of a multipolar world and for France to maintain its independence<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Xi Jinping underscored that regardless of how the external environment changes, both nations should consistently demonstrate the ‘strategic vision and independence of a major country’<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. This statement was widely interpreted as a call for France to resist being fully absorbed into Washington’s containment strategy against China<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Macron, in turn, urged Beijing to cooperate on geopolitics and environment as the European Union seeks China’s help in ending the war in Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The two leaders also exchanged views on the need to reform and improve global governance, with France fully agreeing with Xi’s views on promoting a more balanced global economy<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The discussions also touched upon the need to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait, with France aiming to prevent escalation<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The December 2025 state visit reinforced the Franco-Chinese relationship as a crucial, yet complex, pillar of the EU-China dynamic. The extraordinary personal welcome extended by President Xi Jinping to President Macron successfully achieved a high degree of diplomatic symbolism, underscoring Beijing’s strategy to cultivate Paris as a key partner in its engagement with Europe<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. This warmth, however, masked the underlying strategic and economic friction that continues to define the relationship<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The failure to secure a major commercial deal, such as the anticipated Airbus order, highlighted the limits of charm diplomacy when confronted with China’s broader geopolitical and trade leverage, particularly in its ongoing negotiations with the United States<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Ultimately, the most tangible outcomes were found in the joint statements on global challenges, where both nations reaffirmed their commitment to multilateralism and expanded cooperation in the critical areas of climate change, nuclear energy, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The visit served as a necessary, high-level dialogue to manage a relationship increasingly defined by a delicate balance: France’s need to rebalance trade and protect its strategic interests, and China’s desire to maintain influence in Europe while pushing for a foreign policy independent of American alignment<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p>
