            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, delivered a catastrophic blow to the Caribbean in late October 2025, becoming the strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in Jamaica and causing widespread devastation across Cuba and Haiti. The storm's extreme rapid intensification was linked to exceptionally warm ocean waters, a condition made hundreds of times more likely by human-caused climate change. The immediate aftermath saw nearly six million people affected, with critical infrastructure destroyed, leading to an estimated economic loss equivalent to 30% of Jamaica's Gross Domestic Product. International aid agencies, including the United Nations and the World Food Programme, mobilised a massive, multi-million-dollar response to address the urgent humanitarian crisis, which included mass displacement, food insecurity, and the challenge of clearing millions of tonnes of debris to reach cut-off communities.</p>

           <h2>A Storm of Unprecedented Intensity</h2>
           <p>Tropical Storm Melissa formed in the central Caribbean Sea on 21 October 2025, beginning a meteorological history that would culminate in one of the most destructive storms on record for the region<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The system underwent a period of extreme rapid intensification, a process where its maximum sustained winds increased by at least 50 knots within 24 hours<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Melissa's maximum wind speed increased by 70 mph in a single 24-hour period, fuelled by exceptionally warm ocean waters that were 2.5°F (1.4°C) warmer than average<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Scientists have since determined that these sea surface temperatures, which provided the immense destructive energy for the storm, were made 500 to 900 times more likely by human-caused climate change<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The storm attained Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale on 27 October, reaching peak intensity with sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h)<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. This intensity tied Melissa with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the third-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. On 28 October, Hurricane Melissa made landfall near New Hope, Westmoreland, becoming the strongest hurricane ever to strike Jamaica, surpassing the intensity of Hurricane Gilbert in 1988<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. After crossing Jamaica, the storm weakened but remained a formidable threat, striking eastern Cuba near Chivirico on 29 October as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h)<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The storm's slow movement across the Caribbean allowed it to gather immense energy, exposing millions of people to its destructive power<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Catastrophic Impact on Jamaica</h2>
           <p>The landfall of the Category 5 storm in Jamaica resulted in catastrophic damage, particularly across the western and central regions of the island<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Initial assessments indicated that the economic damage was equivalent to approximately 30% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a figure that was expected to rise as full assessments continued<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The storm generated nearly five million metric tons of debris, a volume that would require an estimated 500,000 standard truckloads to clear<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. This massive volume of rubble, vegetation, and household waste blocked roads, obstructed access to schools, hospitals, clinics, farms, and markets, severely slowing the delivery of relief supplies and the restoration of essential services<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. At one point, at least 75% of the island was without electricity, and telecommunications remained unstable more than a week after the storm<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Over 1.5 million Jamaicans were impacted by the storm, which was described as the worst climate disaster in the nation's history<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The parish of St. Elizabeth, known as the country's 'breadbasket,' was particularly hard hit, with homes, farms, and livelihoods destroyed<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Tens of thousands of homes were damaged, with some towns decimated and up to 90% of buildings in certain areas impacted<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The confirmed death toll in Jamaica reached 45, with 15 people still missing as of 11 November<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Approximately 125,000 residents were displaced, with thousands seeking refuge in emergency shelters<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Devastation and Displacement in Cuba and Haiti</h2>
           <p>Following its passage over Jamaica, Hurricane Melissa brought widespread devastation to eastern Cuba, where it struck as a Category 3 storm<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The storm caused extensive flooding, power outages, and heavy damage, with crops lost and numerous buildings partially or fully destroyed<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Over 700,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, a crucial preparedness measure<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. However, the storm still severely affected an estimated 2.2 million people across the eastern provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, and Guantanamo<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. More than 54,000 people were unable to return to their homes, with 7,500 remaining in official shelters<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The scale of infrastructure damage was immense, with over 90,000 homes, more than 600 health facilities, and over 1,500 educational centres sustaining damage<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Communication failures were widespread, with 241 communities still without access to communication a week after the hurricane, affecting more than 140,000 people<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The storm's path also brought heavy rain and flooding to the neighbouring countries of the Dominican Republic and Haiti<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Haiti, already grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis, experienced significant, localised flooding, particularly along the southern coast<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Authorities in Haiti reported 40 deaths and 13 missing people across seven departments, with homes and infrastructure washed away<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The total confirmed death toll across the affected Caribbean islands reached at least 75 people<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Global Humanitarian Response</h2>
           <p>The scale of the disaster necessitated a massive and coordinated international humanitarian response, with nearly six million people affected across the Caribbean<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The United Nations system and its partners immediately scaled up operations under national leadership<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) launched an urgent appeal for US$74 million to deliver life-saving assistance to up to 1.1 million people across the impacted countries and to coordinate emergency logistics<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. In Cuba, the UN System launched a US$74 million Plan of Action to assist one million people across the four eastern provinces<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. WFP's efforts in Cuba aimed to assist 900,000 people with emergency food assistance for three months, with half of those requiring an additional three months of support<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. In Jamaica, the UN allocated US$4 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. WFP airlifted an initial 2,000 food kits from its Caribbean Regional Logistics Hub in Barbados and planned to assist up to 200,000 people through a mix of in-kind food and cash transfers<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and its national societies mobilised extensive volunteer networks<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The Jamaica Red Cross mobilised 400 volunteers for damage assessment and relief distribution, while the Cuban Red Cross had over 35,000 active volunteers<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The United States also authorised an immediate response, deploying a Disaster Assistance Response Team and urban search-and-rescue teams to the region<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Despite the rapid mobilisation, the delivery of aid was severely hampered by the destruction of infrastructure<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The inability to transport 40,000 tarpaulins due to blocked and damaged roads highlighted the critical shelter concern in Jamaica<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The overwhelming volume of debris and the isolation of communities presented a persistent logistical challenge for all relief agencies<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>Hurricane Melissa served as a stark demonstration of the escalating threat posed by climate change to vulnerable island nations, with its extreme intensity linked directly to unnaturally warm ocean temperatures<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The storm's catastrophic impact, which wiped out an estimated one-third of Jamaica's annual economic output and displaced hundreds of thousands across the Greater Antilles, underscores the urgent need for enhanced climate adaptation and resilient infrastructure<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. While the immediate humanitarian response was swift and coordinated, the long-term recovery for Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti will be a multi-year undertaking, requiring sustained international investment beyond the initial emergency appeals<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The sheer volume of debris and the extensive damage to essential services like healthcare and education facilities present a complex challenge that will define the region's development trajectory for the foreseeable future<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The disaster has forced a critical re-evaluation of preparedness strategies, as the intensity of storms now tests the 'soft limits' of adaptation, demanding a global commitment to both emissions reduction and financial support for climate-vulnerable states<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
