            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The arrival of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House for a meeting with US President Donald Trump marks a profound and controversial shift in global counter-terrorism policy and Middle Eastern geopolitics. Al-Sharaa, who was until recently the leader of an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group and had a $10 million bounty on his head, is the first Syrian head of state to visit Washington since the country’s independence in 1946<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The visit follows the swift overthrow of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024 by al-Sharaa’s forces and a rapid diplomatic normalisation process<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. This normalisation included the United States and the United Nations lifting their respective terrorist designations and sanctions on al-Sharaa and his group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), in a move justified by Washington as necessary to promote stability, counter the Islamic State, and reduce the influence of Iran and Russia in the region<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The dramatic policy reversal has drawn sharp criticism from human rights organisations and Syrian minority groups, who question the sincerity of al-Sharaa’s transformation and warn that legitimising a former extremist leader sets a dangerous international precedent<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Unprecedented Handshake</h2>
           <p>The meeting between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and US President Donald Trump at the White House on a Monday in November 2025 represents a historic and deeply unsettling moment in modern diplomacy<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. It is the first official visit by a Syrian head of state to Washington since the country gained independence in 1946<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The symbolism of the event is stark, as al-Sharaa, who led the rebel forces that toppled the long-standing regime of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, was until recently a designated terrorist with a $10 million bounty on his head<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. President Trump, reflecting on the meeting, described al-Sharaa as a “young, attractive guy” with a “very strong past,” expressing hope that the new leader could steer Syria in a new direction<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The handshake culminates a rapid, six-month diplomatic transformation for al-Sharaa, who was appointed interim President of Syria in January 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. This transformation began with an initial meeting between the two leaders in Riyadh during President Trump’s Middle East tour in May<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The subsequent White House visit was preceded by a series of critical diplomatic steps, including the removal of al-Sharaa and his Interior Minister, Anas Khattab, from the US Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The US State Department’s decision to delist al-Sharaa as a global terrorist was widely anticipated and was followed by a vote in the UN Security Council to lift its own sanctions against him<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The speed of this international normalisation has been viewed by analysts as a clear signal of the international community’s recognition of a post-Assad era in Syria<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>From Insurgent to Statesman</h2>
           <p>The man now known as Ahmed al-Sharaa spent two decades immersed in the world of Islamic jihad, a history that makes his current status as a global statesman extraordinary<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Before adopting the name Ahmed al-Sharaa, he was known by his jihadi nickname, Abu Mohammed al-Golani<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. His ties to Al-Qaeda date back to 2003, when he joined the insurgency following the US-led invasion of Iraq<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. During this period, he helped Al-Qaeda form an offshoot in Iraq, which was responsible for attacks against US forces and the country’s Shiite majority<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Al-Sharaa was detained by the US military in 2005 and spent six years in American and Iraqi prisons before his release in 2011<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Following his release, he became the leader of Jabhat al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda’s official affiliate in Syria, and was designated as a terrorist by the United States in 2013<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. In 2016, he publicly renounced his allegiance to Al-Qaeda, and his group eventually rebranded as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The HTS-led offensive in November 2024, which culminated in the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, ended a brutal 13-year civil war that had been sparked by protests against the Assad family’s half-century of repressive rule<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Since seizing power, al-Sharaa has cultivated a new image, appearing in Western-style attire and giving interviews to American networks, where he has sought to portray his group as no longer a threat to the West<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. This sartorial and political transformation has been a key component of his government’s effort to re-establish ties with world powers that had previously shunned Damascus<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Geopolitical Price of Normalisation</h2>
           <p>The decision by the United States to normalise relations with the new Syrian government is rooted in a complex geopolitical calculus aimed at achieving regional stability and countering rival powers<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The US State Department formally revoked the Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) designation of HTS in July 2025, a move intended to provide sanctions relief to Syria<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This action was framed as fulfilling President Trump’s vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The US government justified the delisting by citing the new Syrian leadership’s progress in meeting specific demands, including working to find missing Americans, eliminating any remaining chemical weapons, and promoting a Syrian-led political process<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The UK followed suit in October 2025, removing HTS from its list of proscribed terrorist organisations to allow for closer engagement with the new Syrian government<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The UN Security Council’s subsequent vote to remove al-Sharaa and his Interior Minister from the 1267/1989/2253 ISIL/Da’esh and Al-Qaida sanctions list was authored by the US, which is the penholder on counter-terrorism<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Washington’s ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, stated that the vote sent a strong political signal that Syria had entered a new phase<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. A key strategic benefit of the HTS takeover is the sharp reduction of influence for Russia and Iran, whose forces and subordinate militias had supported the Assad regime since the 2011 uprising<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Al-Sharaa’s government has demonstrated its intent to realign Syria with the US and the West, despite his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in October<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The new Syrian government has also sought to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism by carrying out nationwide preemptive operations targeting Islamic State cells, with 61 raids and 71 arrests reported just before al-Sharaa’s arrival in Washington<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. It is expected that al-Sharaa will formally sign an agreement to join the international US-led alliance against the Islamic State, a move that could pave the way for a significant US military drawdown from Syria<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Furthermore, the US is reportedly brokering a security pact between Syria and Israel, which may involve US forces using an airbase near Damascus to promote deconfliction<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Shadow of the Past and the Domestic Crisis</h2>
           <p>Despite the diplomatic successes, the new Syrian government faces immense domestic challenges and significant international scepticism regarding its commitment to genuine reform<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The country’s economy has been ravaged by 13 years of civil war and crippling sanctions, with the World Bank estimating the conservative best cost of rebuilding Syria at $216 billion<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Economic and sanctions relief issues are a primary focus for al-Sharaa, who is seeking comprehensive sanctions relief to fund his government and military operations<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. However, the new government’s promises of an inclusive, representative government that protects ethnic and religious minorities have been met with suspicion<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Human rights organisations and leaders of minority communities, including Druze, Alawite, Kurdish, and Christian groups, point to repeated massacres of Druze and Alawite civilians and a lack of representation in the new parliament as evidence that the reforms are limited or hollow<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Critics argue that al-Sharaa’s deep roots in Islamic jihad could lead to further attacks on these vulnerable communities<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The US-sponsored UN resolution to lift sanctions, while passed, was not unanimous, with China abstaining and calling the process “unilateral and politically driven”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This division underscores the lingering international discomfort with legitimising a leader whose past is so closely tied to extremist violence<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The case sets a complex precedent, forcing the international community to weigh the immediate geopolitical benefits of stability and counter-terrorism cooperation against the long-term moral and legal implications of embracing a former jihadi leader<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The White House meeting between President Trump and President al-Sharaa represents a watershed moment, not only for Syria but for the global architecture of counter-terrorism and statecraft<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The speed with which a former Al-Qaeda affiliate was delisted by the US and the UN, and subsequently welcomed into the Oval Office, demonstrates a pragmatic, realpolitik approach to foreign policy<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The stated objectives—to stabilise Syria, eliminate Iranian and Russian influence, and secure counter-terrorism cooperation against the Islamic State—are clear strategic wins for Washington<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Yet, the moral and political cost of this normalisation remains a profound concern<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. By prioritising immediate security and geopolitical realignment over a strict adherence to human rights and accountability for past atrocities, the US has set a powerful, if controversial, precedent<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The long-term success of this policy hinges entirely on the sincerity of al-Sharaa’s transformation and his ability to transition from a military leader to a genuine statesman capable of rebuilding a fractured nation<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Should the new Syrian government fail to deliver on its promises of inclusivity and stability, the White House handshake will be remembered not as a diplomatic triumph, but as the moment a major world power legitimised a former extremist, potentially undermining decades of counter-terrorism doctrine<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
