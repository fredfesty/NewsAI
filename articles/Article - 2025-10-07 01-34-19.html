            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Despite an unprecedented injection of tens of billions of dollars aimed at dramatically expanding its detention capacity, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is encountering significant obstacles in increasing the number of detained individuals. Immigration arrests have seen a decline, and the daily detained population has only marginally increased since the funding surge. Internal critics and former officials attribute this slow progress to a confluence of factors, including bureaucratic hurdles within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and a strategic shift in contracting preferences. A key figure at the centre of this deceleration is reportedly Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser at DHS. His purported emphasis on securing detention agreements with Republican-led state facilities over traditionally more capacious and cost-effective private detention centres is cited as a primary impediment. This operational quagmire unfolds against a backdrop of heightened political tension, with warnings from state governors of potential federal overreach and controversial public displays of immigration enforcement by political commentators, reflecting a deeply polarised national discourse on immigration.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The enforcement of immigration laws in the United States has entered a period of intense activity and considerable controversy. Following a significant legislative push, the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency received a monumental increase in its budget, earmarked for a substantial expansion of its capacity to detain and deport undocumented immigrants.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> This financial augmentation, part of a broader administration strategy to intensify immigration enforcement, was intended to facilitate a significant increase in the number of individuals held in detention pending removal proceedings. However, the anticipated surge in detention numbers has not materialised as expected.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> Instead, the agency has faced a series of challenges that have impeded its ability to utilise the newly allocated funds to rapidly scale up its operations. This has led to internal frustrations and public scrutiny, with questions arising about the efficiency and direction of the administration's deportation agenda. At the heart of the matter are complex issues of procurement, political influence, and the logistical realities of expanding a vast and often contentious detention network.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>A Torrent of Funding Meets a Bottleneck</h3>
            <p>In July 2025, as part of a major spending package colloquially referred to as the "Big, Beautiful Bill," ICE was allocated an unprecedented $45 billion to expand its detention capabilities.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> This infusion of capital was designed to more than double the existing detention capacity, with the goal of increasing the number of available beds to over 100,000 and hiring an additional 10,000 officers.  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> The legislation made ICE the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with its budget for detention and removal operations dwarfing that of other federal law enforcement bodies combined.  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup> The financial scale of this initiative is vast, with the $45 billion for new detention centres being supplemented by approximately $30 billion for arrest and deportation operations over four years.  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup></p>
            <p>Despite this massive financial commitment, the tangible results in terms of increased detention numbers have been underwhelming. Since the funding was approved, the average daily population of migrants in custody has seen only a marginal increase.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> Furthermore, immigration arrests have actually decreased by 11 percent since June 2025, falling significantly short of the administration's reported target of 3,000 arrests per day.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> While overall deportations have tripled since January 2025, the inability to significantly expand the detained population represents a critical bottleneck in the administration's broader deportation strategy.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> This disparity between funding and results has led to what one former DHS employee described as "extreme frustration" within circles aligned with the president's agenda, questioning why the administration lobbied so intensely for funds that it now appears unable to effectively spend.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Lewandowski Factor: A Shift in Strategy</h3>
            <p>A significant portion of the blame for this slow progress, according to internal critics and former officials, is being directed at Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser at the Department of Homeland Security.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> Lewandowski, a long-time political operative associated with Donald Trump, has reportedly exerted considerable influence over the department's contracting strategy for new detention facilities.  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup> The core of the criticism lies in a perceived strategic shift away from utilising privately-run detention centres, which have historically formed the backbone of the U.S. immigration detention system due to their lower costs and larger capacities.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> Instead, under Lewandowski's influence, DHS has appeared to prioritise striking agreements with Republican-led jurisdictions, such as Louisiana and Florida, to house federal immigration detainees in state-run facilities.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup></p>
            <p>This approach has been defended by Lewandowski and his allies as a means of securing fairer agreements and fostering partnerships with politically aligned states.  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> However, critics argue that this strategy is inefficient and is the primary reason for the delay in expanding detention capacity. State facilities are often not equipped to handle the specific needs of immigration detainees and may have less available space compared to the large, purpose-built private detention centres.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> The process of negotiating and finalising these intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs) can also be more complex and time-consuming than contracting with established private prison corporations like CoreCivic and GEO Group, who have long-standing relationships with ICE.  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup></p>
            <p>Adding to the bureaucratic inertia is a reported policy from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, requiring her personal sign-off on any contract exceeding $100,000.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup> This has been identified as another key factor slowing down the procurement process.  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> The combination of a politically driven contracting strategy and stringent internal approval processes has created a significant impediment to the rapid expansion that the massive funding injection was intended to facilitate.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Political Climate: Insurrection Acts and Public Provocations</h3>
            <p>The operational challenges within ICE are unfolding within a highly charged and polarised political environment. The administration's aggressive stance on immigration has been met with fierce opposition from Democratic governors and civil liberties organisations. One of the most striking examples of this tension is the public dispute between the administration and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. Pritzker has repeatedly warned that President Trump is deliberately creating chaos in American cities as a pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act.  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup> This centuries-old law would grant the president the authority to deploy the military domestically to suppress civil disorder.  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup> Pritzker's concerns were amplified by the deployment of federal agents and National Guard troops to Chicago to conduct immigration raids, a move he and other local officials vehemently opposed.  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></sup> The governor has accused the administration of following a "playbook" of causing fear and confusion to justify a military presence in cities.  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup></p>
            <p>This heated rhetoric has been further inflamed by the actions of some of the administration's supporters. In a widely condemned incident, a prominent MAGA-affiliated podcaster, Benny Johnson, posted a controversial AI-generated video.  <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup> The video, which celebrated a recent ICE raid in Chicago, depicted Batman, wearing a sombrero, beating women. This incident, while seemingly on the fringes of the political discourse, is indicative of the inflammatory and often dehumanising nature of the public conversation surrounding immigration. It also highlights the extent to which immigration enforcement has become a cultural and political flashpoint, with both sides engaging in provocative actions and rhetoric.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Realities of Detention: Overcrowding and Inhumane Conditions</h3>
            <p>While the expansion of detention capacity has been slow, the existing network of facilities is already under immense strain. Reports of overcrowding, poor conditions, and a rising number of detainee deaths have plagued the system for years, and the recent push for expansion has exacerbated these issues.  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup> Immigrant justice groups have raised alarms about medical neglect, unsanitary conditions, and the psychological toll of prolonged detention.  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup> In some facilities, detainees have reported being packed together so tightly that they are forced to sleep on the floor.  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup> Access to legal counsel and communication with family members can also be severely restricted, particularly in remote facilities.  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup></p>
            <p>The reliance on private prison companies, which house nearly 90 percent of all immigration detainees, has also been a source of significant controversy.  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> These for-profit corporations have a vested financial interest in maximising the number of detainees and minimising operational costs, which critics argue leads to a systemic neglect of detainee welfare.  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup> The two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group, have seen their stock prices soar in anticipation of lucrative new contracts stemming from the administration's expansion plans.  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup> This has led to accusations that the administration's immigration policies are being driven, at least in part, by the profit motives of its corporate partners.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Broader Context: A System Under Strain</h3>
            <p>The current challenges facing ICE are not occurring in a vacuum. They are the culmination of decades of evolving immigration policy and enforcement strategies. The U.S. immigration detention system has grown exponentially since the 1980s, driven by a series of legislative changes that have expanded the categories of non-citizens subject to mandatory detention. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks further solidified the link between immigration enforcement and national security, leading to a significant increase in funding and resources for these agencies.  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup></p>
            <p>The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy at the border, which led to the separation of thousands of families, brought the issue of immigration detention to the forefront of the national consciousness. While that policy was officially rescinded, the administration's commitment to a hardline approach to immigration has not wavered. The current push to expand detention capacity is a direct continuation of this policy, aimed at deterring illegal immigration and expediting deportations.</p>
            <p>However, the logistical and legal hurdles to achieving this goal are substantial. The process of procuring and opening new detention facilities is complex and often faces legal challenges from local communities and advocacy groups.  <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup> Furthermore, the immigration court system is already facing a massive backlog of cases, with hundreds of thousands of individuals waiting for their day in court.  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup> Simply detaining more people without a corresponding increase in the capacity of the immigration courts will only exacerbate this backlog and lead to even longer periods of detention.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The struggle to expand the United States' immigration detention capacity, despite a massive influx of funding, reveals a complex interplay of political manoeuvring, bureaucratic inefficiency, and deeply entrenched ideological divides. The centralisation of contracting decisions and the apparent prioritisation of political alliances over logistical practicalities, as allegedly championed by Corey Lewandowski, have created a significant bottleneck in the administration's deportation agenda. This internal struggle is mirrored by a volatile external political climate, where the rhetoric of invasion and the threat of invoking extraordinary executive powers have become commonplace.</p>
            <p>The human cost of this stalled but still immense detention system remains a critical concern. Reports of inhumane conditions and the enrichment of private prison companies at the expense of detainee welfare continue to fuel public outrage and legal challenges. As the administration presses forward with its hardline immigration policies, the fundamental questions of efficacy, morality, and the rule of law will continue to dominate the national discourse. The inability to translate a massive financial investment into a correspondingly scaled-up detention network highlights the profound complexities and inherent contradictions of the current approach to immigration enforcement in the United States.</p>
