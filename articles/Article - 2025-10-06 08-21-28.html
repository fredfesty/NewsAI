            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In early October 2025, a legal and constitutional confrontation unfolded in the United States, centred on the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. President Donald Trump's administration attempted to federalise and deploy Oregon's own National Guard to address protests, a move that was swiftly challenged and temporarily blocked by a federal judge. In response, the administration sought to circumvent this ruling by deploying federalised National Guard members from California, and reportedly Texas, to Oregon. This action prompted a further legal challenge from both Oregon and California, culminating in a broader temporary restraining order from the same judge, Karin Immergut, prohibiting the deployment of any state's National Guard to Oregon. The events raised profound questions regarding presidential authority, the Posse Comitatus Act, the Insurrection Act, and the delicate balance of power between the federal government and the states under the U.S. Constitution. The judiciary's intervention underscored the legal limitations on the domestic use of military forces and highlighted the significant political and legal opposition to the administration's tactics.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The deployment of military forces for domestic law enforcement purposes within the United States is a matter of significant legal and historical sensitivity. The nation's foundational principles reflect a deep-seated aversion to the use of a standing army to police its own citizens, a sentiment codified in laws such as the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. This legislation generally prohibits the use of the U.S. Army and Air Force for domestic law enforcement unless expressly authorised by the Constitution or an Act of Congress  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. The National Guard, a reserve military force that typically operates under the command of state governors, occupies a more complex position within this framework  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. While governors can deploy their state's National Guard for a variety of purposes, including law enforcement, the president's authority to do so is more circumscribed  <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. The president can "federalise" a state's National Guard, bringing it under federal command, but this action is typically governed by specific statutes, most notably the Insurrection Act of 1807  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. This Act grants the president the authority to deploy troops domestically under specific circumstances, such as to suppress an insurrection or when a state is unable or unwilling to protect federally guaranteed rights  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. The interpretation and application of these laws have been the subject of intense debate and legal scrutiny throughout American history, forming the backdrop to the events that transpired in Oregon in October 2025.</p>

            <h3>A Contentious History: Federal Intervention in Portland</h3>
            <p>The events of October 2025 were not without precedent. In the summer of 2020, during the widespread protests following the murder of George Floyd, the Trump administration deployed federal law enforcement agents to Portland, ostensibly to protect federal property, particularly the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. This deployment, which included agents from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the U.S. Marshals Service, was met with fierce opposition from state and local officials  <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler argued that the federal presence was unwelcome and was escalating tensions rather than quelling unrest  <sup><a href="#ref36">36</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. Reports of federal agents in unmarked vehicles detaining protesters far from federal property fuelled public outrage and raised serious civil liberties concerns  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. The 2020 deployment led to nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents, with the use of tear gas and less-lethal munitions becoming a common occurrence  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. The experience of 2020 left a lasting legacy of mistrust in Portland towards federal intervention and informed the swift and resolute opposition to the administration's actions in 2025  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The October 2025 Escalation</h3>
            <p>In late September 2025, President Trump announced his intention to deploy troops to Portland, describing the city as "war-ravaged" and citing the need to protect a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility that had been the site of regular, though relatively small, protests  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. On 27 September, he declared he was authorising "Full Force, if necessary"  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. This announcement was met with immediate condemnation from Oregon officials, who contended that the president was either misinformed or deliberately misrepresenting the situation on the ground  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. Governor Tina Kotek stated, "There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. No fires, no bombs, no fatalities due to civil unrest. The only threat we face is to our democracy – and it is being led by President Donald Trump"  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The administration's initial plan was to federalise 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the ICE facility  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. The State of Oregon and the City of Portland promptly filed a lawsuit to block this deployment, arguing that it was an unlawful overreach of presidential authority  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The case was brought before U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a nominee of President Trump from his first term  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The First Judicial Obstacle</h3>
            <p>On Saturday, 4 October 2025, Judge Immergut issued a temporary restraining order, halting the Trump administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. In her ruling, Judge Immergut found that the administration's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts"  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. She noted that the protests outside the ICE facility had been small, with an average of no more than 20 participants, and that there was no evidence of a situation that local and federal law enforcement were incapable of handling  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. The judge concluded that the deployment would likely harm Oregon's state sovereignty and that the conditions for invoking federal military intervention under the law, such as an insurrection or an inability to enforce federal law through regular means, did not exist  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. In a strongly worded opinion, she wrote, "This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs... This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law"  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The restraining order was set to remain in effect for 14 days, until 18 October  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The Trump administration immediately filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>A Calculated Circumvention</h3>
            <p>Hours after Judge Immergut's ruling, the Trump administration moved to bypass the court's order. Instead of using Oregon's National Guard, the administration ordered the deployment of federalised National Guard members from California to Oregon  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. Brigadier General Alan Gronewold, Oregon's adjutant general, stated in a court filing that approximately 100 federalised members of the California National Guard had landed at the Portland Air National Guard Base after midnight on Sunday, 5 October, with another 99 expected to arrive later that day  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. These troops were then moved to Camp Withycombe, a facility operated by the Oregon Military Department in Clackamas County  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This move was met with immediate and forceful condemnation from California officials. Governor Gavin Newsom described the deployment as "a breathtaking abuse of the law and power" and announced that California would take legal action to challenge it  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. He stated that the 300 California National Guard personnel in question had been federalised months prior in response to since-subsided unrest in Los Angeles, and that their redeployment to Oregon was a clear attempt to circumvent the federal court's ruling  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. "The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens," Newsom declared  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>A Widening Legal Battle</h3>
            <p>In response to the deployment of California National Guard troops, the attorneys general of California and Oregon jointly sought a new temporary restraining order from Judge Immergut  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. Their legal argument centred on the violation of state sovereignty and the police powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield argued that "what was unlawful yesterday is unlawful today... the judge's order was not some minor, procedural point for the president to work around"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The legal urgency was heightened by the revelation, through a memo from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth submitted to the court, that the administration was also activating up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard for potential deployment to Oregon and Illinois  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. This development prompted the states to broaden their request for a restraining order to apply to all National Guard troops from any state  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Second, Broader Injunction</h3>
            <p>On the evening of Sunday, 5 October 2025, Judge Immergut held an emergency hearing and granted the states' request for a broader temporary restraining order  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. This new order prohibited the Trump administration from deploying or relocating any federalised members of any state's National Guard to Oregon  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. The order was to remain in effect until 19 October  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>During the hearing, Judge Immergut directly challenged the Justice Department's attorney, questioning how the deployment of the California National Guard was not in "direct contravention" of her previous order  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. "You're an officer of the court. Aren't defendants circumventing my order?" she asked  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. The judge expressed that she was "certainly troubled by now hearing that both California and Texas are being sent to Oregon, which does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order"  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. She found that the administration's actions appeared to violate both federal statute and the Tenth Amendment  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. The judge denied the government's request for a stay of her order, citing the emergency nature of the situation and the lack of new facts to justify a change in her previous ruling  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Constitutional and Legal Framework Under Scrutiny</h3>
            <p>The events in Oregon brought several key legal and constitutional principles into sharp focus. The Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states, was a central pillar of the legal challenge brought by Oregon and California  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. They argued that the unilateral deployment of military forces for domestic law enforcement infringed upon their sovereign right to police their own territories  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Posse Comitatus Act, while not directly applicable to the National Guard operating under state command (Title 32 status), becomes relevant when the Guard is federalised (Title 10 status)  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. Once federalised, National Guard personnel are generally subject to the same restrictions as active-duty military forces, meaning they cannot be used for civilian law enforcement unless an exception, such as the Insurrection Act, is invoked  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. The legal challenges in Oregon argued that the administration was attempting to use federalised troops for law enforcement purposes without meeting the high threshold required by the Insurrection Act  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Insurrection Act itself was at the heart of the dispute. The Act outlines specific scenarios in which the president can deploy the military domestically  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. These include a request from a state legislature or governor, a rebellion against the authority of the United States, or a situation where a state is unable or unwilling to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. Judge Immergut's ruling explicitly stated that the conditions in Portland did not meet the criteria for invoking this extraordinary authority  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. The administration's attempt to deploy troops from other states was seen by its opponents as a tactic to bypass the consent of the target state's governor, a move that raises profound questions about the balance of power in the American federal system  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Political Reactions and Broader Implications</h3>
            <p>The legal battle was accompanied by a torrent of political reaction. Supporters of the administration, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, decried Judge Immergut's ruling as a "legal insurrection," arguing that the president, as commander-in-chief, has the authority to protect federal property and personnel  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. The White House maintained that the president "exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Conversely, Democratic officials in Oregon, California, and Illinois, where a similar deployment of Texas National Guard troops was anticipated, framed the administration's actions as a politically motivated assault on the rule of law and an attempt to create chaos in cities led by political opponents  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker labelled the potential deployment in his state as "Trump's Invasion," accusing the administration of wanting to "create the war zone so that they can send in even more troops"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The events in Oregon were seen by many as part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration's use of federal power in cities with Democratic leadership  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>. Since the beginning of his second term, the president had sent or discussed sending troops to numerous cities, often over the objections of local officials  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. This strategy has consistently raised concerns about the politicisation of the military and federal law enforcement agencies  <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. The repeated judicial rebukes in the Oregon case underscored the significant legal hurdles to such deployments and highlighted the judiciary's role as a check on executive power. The standoff in Oregon served as a stark illustration of the enduring tensions in American governance between federal authority and states' rights, and the profound legal and constitutional questions that arise when a president seeks to deploy military force on domestic soil.</p>
