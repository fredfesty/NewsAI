            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A trade dispute between the United States and Canada escalated dramatically after the provincial government of Ontario aired a television advertisement in the US that used a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan to criticise tariffs. President Donald Trump immediately announced the termination of all trade negotiations, accusing Canada of 'egregious behavior' and attempting to influence US court decisions. The move forced Ontario's Premier, Doug Ford, to pause the controversial ad campaign in an effort to salvage the stalled diplomatic process.</p>

           <h2>The Sudden Termination of Negotiations</h2>
           <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate termination of all trade negotiations with Canada in a late-night post on his Truth Social platform.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> The abrupt decision was a direct response to a television advertisement aired in the United States by the government of Ontario, which featured the voice of former President Ronald Reagan criticising trade barriers.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, later confirmed that all trade negotiations with Ottawa had been suspended.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> In his social media post, President Trump labelled the advertisement as “FAKE” and accused Canada of “fraudulently” using it.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> He further claimed the ad was an attempt to interfere with the US Supreme Court hearings on the legality of his global tariffs, which were scheduled to begin on 5 November.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Ontario’s Costly Anti-Tariff Campaign</h2>
           <p>The advertisement was part of a $75 million campaign launched by the government of Ontario, led by Premier Doug Ford, earlier in October.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> The province, which has been particularly hard-hit by the escalating trade war, sought to appeal directly to American audiences, especially in Republican-held areas where President Trump draws support.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> The one-minute commercial used excerpts from a 1987 radio address by President Reagan on free and fair trade.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> In the voice-over, Reagan is heard stating that “high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> The former president’s remarks continued, warning that markets would then “shrink and collapse,” businesses would “shut down,” and “millions of people lose their jobs.”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> The ad was broadcast on major US networks, including during the first two games of the World Series.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Reagan Foundation’s Rebuke</h2>
           <p>The use of the former Republican president’s words drew a sharp rebuke from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> The Foundation issued a statement claiming the ad used “selective audio” and “misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> The organisation also noted that the Ontario government had not sought or received permission to use and edit the remarks, and it was reviewing its legal options.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> While the ad’s quotes were all present in the original 1987 address, the full speech did include a section where Reagan defended some tariffs the US had imposed on Japan at the time, which was omitted from the Ontario commercial.<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> Despite the controversy, some experts in political communication suggested the ad was legally sound, as Reagan’s speech is in the public domain and US law allows significant latitude for political commentary.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Retreat to Salvage Diplomacy</h2>
           <p>The termination of talks came after months of building trade tensions, which saw Washington impose an initial 25% tariff on Canadian goods, including steel, aluminium, timber, and cars, a rate that was later raised to 35% in August.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> Following President Trump’s announcement, Premier Doug Ford initially defended the ad, posting the full link to Reagan’s 1987 radio address and stating that the two countries are “friends, neighbours and allies.”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> However, within hours, Ford announced that the ad campaign would be paused starting the following Monday, a decision made after a conversation with Prime Minister Mark Carney.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> Ford stated that the intention of the campaign was to initiate a conversation about the impact of tariffs and that the goal of reaching US audiences “at the highest levels” had been achieved.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> Prime Minister Carney, whose government was reportedly caught by surprise by the termination, said Canada could not control US trade policy but remained ready to resume negotiations when the Americans were prepared to have those discussions.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> The Canadian federal government has since focused on diversifying its trading relationships in response to the ongoing threat of US tariffs.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The episode underscores the volatile nature of the US-Canada trade relationship under the current administration, where a provincial government’s political advertisement was deemed sufficient cause to halt high-level diplomatic negotiations.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> The move by Premier Ford to pause the campaign represents a tactical retreat aimed at creating space for the resumption of talks, though Ottawa has received no indication of when or if negotiations might restart.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> The core issue of US tariffs on Canadian goods remains unresolved, and the dispute highlights the deep political divisions within the US over protectionist trade policy, which Canada attempted to exploit by invoking the legacy of a revered Republican figure.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></p>
