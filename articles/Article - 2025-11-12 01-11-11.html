            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>A new wave of scientific breakthroughs is redefining the capabilities of microbial life and cellular engineering, moving fundamental biology from the laboratory bench to industrial and clinical application. Researchers have uncovered a novel bacterial metabolism, dubbed MISO, where microbes 'breathe' iron minerals to detoxify marine environments, offering a natural mechanism to combat oceanic dead zones. Simultaneously, advances in enzyme engineering, powered by artificial intelligence, have yielded a 'plastic-eating' enzyme capable of breaking down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste in under 24 hours, accelerating the prospect of a circular plastics economy. In medicine, a two-part bacterial consortium has demonstrated the ability to eradicate tumours in preclinical models without relying on the patient's immune system, addressing a critical limitation of current immunotherapies. Furthermore, the integration of AI with cellular biology is decoding the complex chemical language of the human gut microbiome and inspiring a new generation of ion-based computing systems that mimic the learning processes of the brain's synapses.</p>

           <h2>The Deep Ecology of Rust-Breathing Microbes</h2>
           <p>The planet’s most fundamental biogeochemical cycles are being re-evaluated following the discovery of a previously unknown microbial metabolism in marine sediments and wetland soils<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. An international team of researchers, led by microbiologists at the University of Vienna, identified a group of microorganisms, now known as MISO bacteria, that possess the unique ability to ‘breathe’ iron minerals<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. This process, termed MISO metabolism, involves the microbes using solid iron(III) oxide minerals—essentially rust—as an electron acceptor to oxidise toxic hydrogen sulfide<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas often found in oxygen-poor environments, and its accumulation is a primary driver in the formation of oceanic ‘dead zones’ where most marine life cannot survive<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. Until this discovery, the reaction between sulfide and iron minerals was believed to be a purely abiotic, or chemical, process<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. The new research demonstrates that microorganisms are, in fact, the main force behind this transformation in natural environments, performing the reaction at a much faster rate than its purely chemical counterpart<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The MISO metabolism links the cycling of sulfur, iron, and carbon in oxygen-free settings, directly producing sulfate and bypassing intermediate steps in the sulfur cycle<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. Scientists estimate that MISO activity in marine sediments could be responsible for as much as seven per cent of all global sulfide oxidation to sulfate<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. This natural detoxification mechanism is continuously fuelled by the steady flow of reactive iron entering the oceans from rivers and melting glaciers<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The finding not only highlights the metabolic ingenuity of microorganisms but also suggests a powerful, natural ally in mitigating the expansion of oxygen-depleted aquatic environments<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>Engineering the Circular Plastics Economy</h2>
           <p>The global crisis of plastic pollution, with hundreds of millions of tonnes of waste disposed of annually, has spurred a race to develop biological recycling solutions<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. A significant breakthrough in this area involves the engineering of a highly efficient, plastic-degrading enzyme<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin utilised artificial intelligence and machine learning to engineer a variant of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase enzyme<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. This new enzyme, named Functional, Active, Stable, and Tolerate PETase, or FAST-PETase, is capable of breaking down PET plastic into its original molecular components in under 24 hours<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. PET is a widely used polymer, accounting for approximately 12 per cent of all global solid waste, and is the material used in most plastic bottles and polyester clothing fibres<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. The development builds upon earlier discoveries, such as the *Ideonella sakaiensis* bacterium found in Japan in 2016, which naturally evolved the ability to degrade plastic<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. Previous attempts to use enzymes for PET breakdown were often hampered by the enzymes’ vulnerability to temperature and pH fluctuations, as well as their slow reaction rates<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. The FAST-PETase, however, functions effectively at 'normal' temperatures, making it robust enough for non-laboratory, industrial applications<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. The process demonstrated a complete circular recycling loop, where plastic samples were broken down and the resulting materials were used to generate entirely new pieces of PET<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. This technology holds immense promise for cleaning up landfills and enabling a truly circular economy for plastics, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional recycling methods that struggle with coloured, opaque, and multilayered PET products<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>A New Paradigm for Cancer Treatment</h2>
           <p>Oncology research has seen a major advancement with the development of a bacteria-based cancer therapy that operates independently of the patient’s immune system<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This innovation, known as AUN therapy, directly addresses a critical limitation of modern immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells, which are often ineffective for patients whose immune systems are compromised by chemotherapy or radiotherapy<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The AUN therapy, developed by a joint research team from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Daiichi Sankyo, and the University of Tsukuba, uses a consortium of two naturally occurring bacterial species<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The first bacterium, *Proteus mirabilis* (A-gyo), is a tumour-resident microbe, while the second, *Rhodopseudomonas palustris* (UN-gyo), is a photosynthetic bacterium<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The two species work synergistically to achieve significant tumour eradication in both murine and human cancer models, even in environments lacking immune cell involvement<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving the selective destruction of tumour blood vessels and cancer cells<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. A key element is a structural transformation in A-gyo, where tumour-derived metabolites trigger a process called filamentation, which enhances its anti-tumour potency<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Furthermore, the ratio of the bacteria within the tumour shifts dramatically during the treatment, moving from an initial 3 per cent A-gyo to 97 per cent UN-gyo to a final balance of approximately 99 per cent A-gyo to 1 per cent UN-gyo, which optimises the cancer-killing effect<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The therapy has also shown high biocompatibility and minimal side effects, notably suppressing the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a serious immune reaction associated with some immunotherapies<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The research team plans to establish a startup to accelerate the technology toward clinical trials within six years, marking a potential new era for patients previously excluded from effective immunotherapy<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Hidden Speed of Bacterial Spread</h2>
           <p>A surprising finding in public health microbiology has revealed that certain strains of common gut bacteria can spread through human populations at rates comparable to highly transmissible viruses<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the University of Oslo, and other collaborators in the UK and Norway, estimated the transmission rates of *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) for the first time in a community setting<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The study focused on three closely related genotypes of the main *E. coli* type ST131, which is a frequent cause of urinary tract and bloodstream infections and is often resistant to multiple antibiotics<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The analysis, which used genomic data to model bacterial transmission, found that one strain, ST131-A, spreads between individuals at a velocity similar to that of the swine flu (H1N1)<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. This finding was unexpected because, unlike influenza viruses, *E. coli* is not transmitted through airborne droplets but via the fecal-oral route, involving hands, surfaces, and contaminated food or drink<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The ability of a gut-colonising bacterium to spread so efficiently demands a re-evaluation of public health monitoring and hygiene strategies<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The other two variants investigated, ST131-C1 and ST131-C2, which are multi-drug resistant, did not spread as quickly among healthy individuals<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. However, these resistant strains pose a major threat in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and care homes, where they can propagate more swiftly among vulnerable and immunocompromised patients<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>Artificial Intelligence and the Microbial Language</h2>
           <p>The complexity of the human gut microbiome, which contains an estimated 100 trillion bacterial cells, has long presented a formidable challenge to researchers seeking to understand its influence on health<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Scientists at the University of Tokyo have now deployed a specialised form of artificial intelligence to decode the intricate chemical communication within this ecosystem<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The system, a Bayesian neural network called VBayesMM, was designed to identify genuine biological links between specific bacterial groups and the thousands of chemical compounds, or metabolites, they produce<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. These metabolites act as chemical messengers, circulating throughout the body and influencing metabolism, immunity, and even brain function<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Traditional data analysis methods often struggle to distinguish meaningful biological relationships from random correlations within the vast, high-dimensional datasets of the microbiome<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. VBayesMM addresses this by using a Bayesian approach that measures the uncertainty in its predictions, thereby helping to prevent overconfident or incorrect conclusions<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. When tested on real-world data from studies on obesity, sleep disorders, and cancer, the AI system consistently outperformed existing methods<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The ability to accurately map these bacteria-metabolite relationships moves research closer to the ultimate goal of personalised medicine, where specific bacterial targets could be identified for dietary or therapeutic interventions<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>Bio-Inspired Computing and Synaptic Mimicry</h2>
           <p>The field of bio-inspired technology is advancing rapidly, with researchers looking to cellular mechanisms to develop new forms of computing<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. Scientists at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have made a significant step by unravelling the complex behaviour of biological nanopores, tiny molecular holes found in cell membranes<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. These pore-forming proteins, such as the bacterial pore aerolysin, are essential for molecular transport in nature and are widely used in biotechnology for applications like DNA sequencing<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The EPFL team investigated two puzzling behaviours of these pores: rectification, where ion flow changes based on the applied voltage’s sign, and gating, where ion flow suddenly decreases or stops<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>. Through experiments with 26 engineered variants of aerolysin, the researchers discovered that these effects are governed by the pore’s internal electrical charges and their interaction with passing ions<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. Crucially, the team demonstrated that this understanding allows for the fine-tuning of nanopore properties<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. They successfully engineered a nanopore that mimics synaptic plasticity, the brain’s ability to modulate the strength of neural connections in response to stimuli<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. This molecular ‘learning’ from voltage pulses suggests a new bio-inspired computing paradigm<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. By harnessing the dynamics of ion flow, these systems could one day form the basis of ion-based processors, offering a fundamentally different approach to information processing than current electronic systems<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The confluence of microbiology, cellular engineering, and artificial intelligence is ushering in a transformative era of scientific capability. From the deep ocean to the human gut, microscopic life is proving to be a powerful, adaptable engine for both planetary and human health solutions<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The discovery of MISO bacteria fundamentally alters the understanding of global element cycles, providing a biological mechanism for environmental detoxification<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. Simultaneously, the engineering of enzymes like FAST-PETase, guided by machine learning, demonstrates a clear path toward industrial-scale biological solutions for the plastic waste crisis<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. In medicine, the development of immune-independent bacterial therapies, such as AUN, offers a lifeline to immunocompromised patients, moving beyond the limitations of current immune-dependent treatments<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. These advancements, coupled with the use of AI to decode the complex language of the microbiome and to inspire new forms of ion-based computing, illustrate a profound shift in how scientists interact with and harness the natural world<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>. The smallest organisms are increasingly providing the largest solutions to the most complex global challenges, signalling a future where biotechnology plays a central role in ecological and medical remediation<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>.</p>
