            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>On the 4th of October 2025, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan elected Sanae Takaichi as its new president, a decision that positions her to become the nation's first female prime minister  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. This historic event unfolds against a backdrop of profound political instability, economic stagnation, and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific region  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. Takaichi, a staunch conservative and a protégée of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, assumes leadership of a party grappling with declining public trust and the loss of its majority in both houses of the Diet  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. Her victory, secured in a run-off against the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, signals a potential shift to the right in Japanese politics  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Sanae Takaichi's rise to power, examining the political context that precipitated her election, her personal and political background, her core policy platforms, and the potential implications of her premiership for both domestic and international affairs. It navigates the complexities of her conservative ideology, her approach to gender issues, and the formidable challenges that await her as she prepares to lead the world's fourth-largest economy  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The election of Sanae Takaichi as the leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the 4th of October 2025, represents a watershed moment in the nation's political history  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. At the age of 64, this veteran politician is poised to shatter the highest glass ceiling in Japanese public life, becoming the first woman to hold the office of prime minister  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. Her ascent comes at a time of significant turmoil for both the LDP and the country at large. Japan is currently navigating a period of unusual political instability, having seen a succession of short-lived premierships in recent years  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. The nation is also grappling with persistent economic challenges, including rising prices and stagnant wages, alongside the long-term demographic crisis of an ageing and shrinking population  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. Furthermore, the geopolitical landscape of the Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly fraught, with the rise of China presenting a significant strategic challenge  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Takaichi's victory is not merely symbolic. A self-proclaimed admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, she is known for her hard-line conservative and nationalist views  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. Her political philosophy is deeply rooted in the legacy of her mentor, the late Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. This ideological alignment suggests a continuation, and perhaps an intensification, of the rightward shift in Japanese politics that Abe initiated. Her policy platform encompasses a robust national security stance, a commitment to revising Japan's pacifist constitution, and a continuation of the "Abenomics" economic stimulus programme  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>However, Takaichi's leadership is not without its complexities and controversies. Despite her historic achievement as a woman reaching the pinnacle of Japanese politics, she is not known as an advocate for gender equality  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. Her opposition to policies such as allowing married couples to have different surnames and permitting female members of the imperial family to ascend the throne has drawn criticism from gender equality advocates  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. Furthermore, her hawkish foreign policy and revisionist views on Japan's wartime history are likely to create friction with neighbouring countries, particularly China and South Korea  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This article will delve into the multifaceted dimensions of Sanae Takaichi's impending premiership. It will begin by providing a detailed background of the political circumstances that led to the 2025 LDP leadership election, including the resignation of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, and the LDP's recent electoral setbacks  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. It will then offer an in-depth exploration of Takaichi's personal and political journey, from her unconventional youth to her extensive career in government  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. The subsequent sections will meticulously analyse her key policy positions on the economy, national security, constitutional reform, and social issues, drawing on her past statements and policy proposals. Finally, the article will assess the potential domestic and international ramifications of her leadership, considering the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Japan under its first female prime minister.</p>

            <h3>The Political Climate Preceding the 2025 LDP Election</h3>
            <p>To comprehend the significance of Sanae Takaichi's election, it is crucial to understand the turbulent political landscape that Japan has been navigating in the years leading up to 2025. The nation has experienced a period of marked political instability, with a high turnover of prime ministers, a phenomenon reminiscent of the "revolving door" era between 2006 and 2012  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. This instability has been a symptom of deeper issues within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and a growing sense of public disillusionment.</p>
            <p>The premiership of Shigeru Ishiba, Takaichi's immediate predecessor, was short-lived, lasting less than a year  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. Ishiba, a moderate figure within the LDP, came to power in September 2024, defeating Takaichi in that year's leadership election  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. However, his tenure was plagued by internal party divisions and a series of damaging electoral defeats  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The LDP's poor performance in the October 2024 general election and the July 2025 House of Councillors election resulted in the party losing its majority in both chambers of the Diet for the first time since its founding in 1955  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>. This historic loss of control created a "double-minority government," severely hampering the administration's ability to pass legislation and govern effectively  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The electoral setbacks were a clear indication of public discontent with the LDP. Voters were increasingly frustrated by a series of political funding scandals that had eroded trust in the ruling party, as well as the government's perceived failure to adequately address the rising cost of living  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The "black money" scandal, which heavily implicated members of the Abe faction that now supports Takaichi, was particularly damaging  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. This confluence of economic hardship and political scandal created a fertile ground for a change in leadership.</p>
            <p>Faced with mounting pressure from within the LDP and plummeting approval ratings, Shigeru Ishiba announced his intention to resign as party president and prime minister on the 7th of September 2025  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. His resignation triggered the 2025 LDP presidential election, setting the stage for a contest that was widely seen as a battle for the soul of the party  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Rise of Populism and the Sanseito Party</h3>
            <p>A notable development in the period leading up to the 2025 election was the rise of the populist Sanseito party  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. This new political force surged from just two seats to 15 in the July 2025 upper house elections, capitalizing on the growing discontent among younger and unaffiliated voters  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. Sanseito's platform is characterized by a staunchly conservative, anti-globalisation agenda, with a particular focus on criticising foreign tourism and immigration, which it blames for inflation and social disorder  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. The party's slogan, "Japanese First," echoes the nationalist sentiments that have been gaining traction in various parts of the world  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The success of Sanseito sent shockwaves through the political establishment and highlighted a shift in the concerns of a segment of the Japanese electorate. Issues such as immigration, which had previously not been a major feature of election campaigns, were suddenly thrust into the spotlight  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. This shift in the political discourse undoubtedly influenced the LDP leadership race, with candidates, including Takaichi, adopting tougher stances on immigration and foreign influence to appeal to this growing constituency of voters  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. Takaichi, for example, has called for reconsidering policies that allow people with "completely different cultures and backgrounds" into Japan  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The 2025 Liberal Democratic Party Presidential Election</h3>
            <p>The 2025 LDP presidential election saw five candidates vying for the party's top post: Sanae Takaichi, Shinjiro Koizumi, Yoshimasa Hayashi, Takayuki Kobayashi, and Toshimitsu Motegi  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. The election was conducted in a two-round system. The first round involved votes from both LDP members of the Diet and rank-and-file party members across the country  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. If no candidate secured an outright majority in the first round, a run-off was to be held between the top two contenders  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>As the campaign progressed, Takaichi and Koizumi emerged as the clear frontrunners  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>. Takaichi, with her strong conservative credentials and backing from the Abe faction, appealed to the party's right-wing base and grassroots members  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. Koizumi, the son of the popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, presented himself as a more moderate and reform-minded candidate, emphasizing the need for generational change  <sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>In the first round of voting on the 4th of October 2025, Takaichi secured the highest number of votes but fell short of a majority, with 183 out of 589 votes (31.07%)  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. Koizumi came in second with 164 votes (27.84%), setting the stage for a run-off between the two  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. In the second round, where the votes of Diet members carried greater weight, Takaichi emerged victorious, garnering 185 votes to Koizumi's 156  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. This decisive victory made her the first female president of the Liberal Democratic Party  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Although the LDP-led coalition no longer holds a majority in parliament, Takaichi is widely expected to be confirmed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote, likely to be held around the 15th of October 2025  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. This is due to the fact that the LDP remains the largest single party, and the opposition parties are highly fragmented and unlikely to unite behind a single candidate of their own  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Early Life and Pre-Political Career</h3>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi was born on the 7th of March 1961, in Nara Prefecture, in the Kansai region of western Japan  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Her background is somewhat unconventional for a Japanese politician, as she does not come from a political dynasty  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Her early life was marked by a rebellious streak; during her university years, she was a drummer in a heavy-metal band and enjoyed riding motorcycles and scuba diving  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. These aspects of her youth stand in stark contrast to the typically staid image of Japanese politicians and have contributed to her unique public persona.</p>
            <p>Takaichi pursued her higher education at Kobe University, where she graduated from the Faculty of Business Administration  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Following her graduation, she attended the prestigious Matsushita Institute of Government and Management, an institution known for cultivating future leaders in Japanese politics and business  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Before entering the political arena, Takaichi worked as an author, a legislative aide, and a broadcaster  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. This early career path provided her with valuable experience in communication and public policy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Entry into Politics and Early Career</h3>
            <p>Takaichi's political career began in 1993 when she was first elected to the House of Representatives as an independent candidate  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. She initially joined the minor "Liberals" party, which soon merged into the New Frontier Party  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. She was re-elected in 1996 as a candidate for the New Frontier Party  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. However, in a pivotal move that would shape her future career, she switched her allegiance to the Liberal Democratic Party in the same year, responding to recruitment efforts from the then-Secretary-General of the LDP, Koichi Kato  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Within the LDP, Takaichi quickly established herself as a rising star on the party's conservative wing. She became a protégée of Shinzo Abe, a relationship that would prove to be instrumental in her political advancement  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. During Abe's first tenure as prime minister, Takaichi held several ministerial positions, including Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs, Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy, and Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Gender Equality  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Following the LDP's return to power in 2012 under Abe's second administration, Takaichi was appointed to the influential position of head of the party's Policy Research Council  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. She also served as Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Her long and varied career in senior government roles has provided her with extensive experience in a wide range of policy areas.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Previous Leadership Bids and Political Evolution</h3>
            <p>Takaichi's path to the LDP presidency was not a straightforward one. She made two previous, unsuccessful bids for the party leadership. Her first attempt was in the 2021 LDP leadership election, where she placed third  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. At that time, she was considered a favourite of conservatives with hawkish views on defence and diplomacy  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. Her second attempt was in the 2024 leadership election, where she came in first in the initial round of voting but narrowly lost to Shigeru Ishiba in the run-off  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>In the run-up to the 2025 election, observers noted a conscious effort by Takaichi to soften her political brand. She began referring to herself as a "moderate conservative" and was more circumspect in her comments on controversial issues, such as her intention to visit the Yasukuni Shrine as prime minister  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. This shift in rhetoric was likely a strategic move to broaden her appeal beyond her traditional right-wing base and position herself as a more unifying figure for the fractured LDP. Despite this moderation in her public pronouncements, her core political positions remain firmly rooted in conservative and nationalist principles.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Economic Policy: A Return to Abenomics</h3>
            <p>At the heart of Sanae Takaichi's economic agenda is a commitment to the principles of "Abenomics," the signature economic policy of her mentor, Shinzo Abe  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. This approach is predicated on the "three arrows" of aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms designed to boost private sector investment  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Takaichi has consistently advocated for a continuation of these policies, arguing that they are necessary to revive Japan's stagnant economy  <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>A key tenet of her economic philosophy is the need for expansionary fiscal policy. She has expressed a willingness to increase government spending, even if it means issuing more deficit-covering bonds, to fund measures aimed at stimulating economic growth and cushioning the impact of the rising cost of living on households  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. In a recent interview, she proposed a refundable tax credit programme specifically designed to reduce the burden on middle- and low-income groups  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. She has also indicated a desire to discuss the abolition of the provisional gasoline tax surcharge and to raise the basic income tax deduction  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. Her rationale for this approach is encapsulated in her statement that "the greatest debt passed to future generations is not financial debt but lost growth," which underscores her belief in the primacy of growth over fiscal consolidation  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Takaichi's stance on monetary policy is also in line with the Abenomics framework. She has been a vocal critic of the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates, arguing that such moves threaten to stifle economic recovery  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. She adheres to the traditional reflationist view that the government should have a significant say in the broad direction of monetary policy, raising the possibility of increased political intervention in the central bank's operations  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>In addition to these macroeconomic policies, Takaichi has placed a strong emphasis on economic security  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. She has advocated for greater measures to safeguard Japan's supply chains and technology sectors, including tighter screening of foreign investment and the creation of a Japanese version of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. She has also called for stricter rules on land acquisition by non-resident foreigners  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>National Security and Defence: A More Assertive Japan</h3>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi is a prominent security hawk, and her views on national defence and foreign policy represent a significant departure from Japan's post-war pacifist stance  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. She is a firm advocate for revising Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, the clause that renounces war as a sovereign right of the nation and prohibits the maintenance of land, sea, and air forces  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. Her goal, which is a long-held ambition of conservative forces in Japan, is to formally recognise the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) as a national military and to enable a more proactive defence posture  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Takaichi has consistently called for a substantial increase in Japan's defence budget, arguing for spending to be raised beyond the current target of 2 percent of GDP  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. She supports the expansion of Japan's capabilities in areas such as space, cyber, and missile defence  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. She has also proposed the establishment of a "National Intelligence Bureau" to enhance the government's intelligence-gathering capabilities  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. Her overarching vision is for Japan to "stand firmly on its own feet" in matters of security, reducing its reliance on the United States and developing the capacity to respond independently to regional threats  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Her foreign policy is guided by a "Japan First" principle, which, while not a rejection of international cooperation, prioritizes the nation's own interests  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. She is a strong proponent of the U.S.-Japan alliance, viewing it as the cornerstone of Japan's security  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. However, she has also demonstrated a willingness to challenge the United States on what she perceives as unequal aspects of their relationship. For instance, she has been critical of the U.S.-Japan tariff negotiations and has suggested that the deal could be renegotiated if it is found to be detrimental to Japan's national interests  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Takaichi's stance on regional relations is particularly hawkish, especially towards China. She is considered a "China hawk" and has repeatedly voiced concerns about China's military and economic expansion  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. She has also cultivated close ties with Taiwan, visiting the island in April 2025 and meeting with President Lai Ching-te  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. She has echoed Shinzo Abe's sentiment that a "Taiwan emergency is a Japan emergency" and has even called for a "quasi-security alliance" with Taipei  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. This position is likely to be a major point of contention in Japan's relationship with Beijing.</p>
            <p>Her relationship with South Korea is also likely to be strained. Takaichi has taken a hard-line stance on historical issues, including the "comfort women" issue, and has been a frequent visitor to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honours Japan's war dead, including convicted Class-A war criminals from the Second World War  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. During the LDP leadership campaign, she argued that Japanese cabinet ministers should confidently attend the "Takeshima Day" event, which asserts Japan's claim to the disputed Dokdo/Takeshima islands  <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. These positions are likely to reignite historical disputes and complicate diplomatic relations with Seoul.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Social and Cultural Policies: A Defence of Tradition</h3>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi's social and cultural policies are deeply rooted in a traditionalist and conservative worldview  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. She has consistently opposed progressive social reforms, arguing that they threaten to undermine Japan's traditional family values and social structure  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent examples of her social conservatism is her staunch opposition to same-sex marriage  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. Despite growing public support for marriage equality in Japan, Takaichi has remained steadfast in her view that marriage should be between a man and a woman.</p>
            <p>She is also a vocal opponent of allowing married couples to use separate surnames, a policy change that is widely supported by the public and seen as a key step towards gender equality  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. Takaichi has argued that a dual-surname system "may destroy the social structure based on family units"  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. This position has drawn significant criticism, particularly given that Takaichi herself uses her maiden name in her professional life  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Her traditionalist views also extend to the issue of imperial succession. Takaichi opposes any changes to the current law that restricts the Chrysanthemum Throne to male heirs in the paternal line  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. This stance puts her at odds with a majority of the Japanese public, who support allowing women to become reigning empresses.</p>
            <p>On the issue of immigration, Takaichi has adopted an increasingly hard-line position, reflecting the growing populist sentiment in Japan  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. She has called for tighter immigration controls and has expressed concerns about the social impact of allowing in people from "completely different cultures and backgrounds"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>While she has vowed to increase the number of female ministers in her cabinet, her broader policy platform and her history of opposing gender equality measures have led many to question whether her premiership will bring about any meaningful progress for women in Japan  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. Critics argue that her focus is on supporting women within their traditional roles as mothers and wives, rather than challenging the structural inequalities that hinder their advancement in society  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Domestic Implications: A Divided Nation</h3>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi's premiership is set to begin at a moment of deep division within Japanese society and politics. Her immediate task will be to unite a fractured Liberal Democratic Party, which is still reeling from its recent electoral defeats and internal power struggles  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The close result of the leadership election run-off suggests that the party is far from unified, with a significant moderate wing that may be resistant to her right-wing agenda.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Takaichi will have to navigate the complexities of governing with a minority in both houses of the Diet  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. This will necessitate building coalitions and seeking cooperation from opposition parties to pass legislation, a task that will be made difficult by her strong ideological convictions  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. Her ability to compromise and engage in cross-party dialogue will be crucial to her success.</p>
            <p>Restoring public trust in the LDP will be another major challenge  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. The party's image has been tarnished by a series of scandals, and there is a widespread public perception that the LDP is out of touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens. Takaichi's association with the Abe faction, which was at the centre of the recent "black money" scandal, could be a liability in this regard  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Her economic policies, while popular with some segments of the electorate, are also likely to be a source of contention. Critics of Abenomics argue that it has exacerbated wealth inequality and failed to deliver sustainable growth, while significantly increasing Japan's national debt  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. Takaichi will face pressure to demonstrate that her "new Abenomics" can address these shortcomings and deliver tangible benefits to a wider range of the population.</p>
            <p>On social issues, Takaichi's conservative stance puts her at odds with a growing segment of the Japanese public, particularly younger generations, who are more liberal on issues such as same-sex marriage and gender equality. Her opposition to these reforms could further alienate these voters and deepen the cultural divides within Japanese society.</p>
            <p>The symbolic significance of Japan having its first female prime minister cannot be understated  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. However, as many commentators have noted, Takaichi's personal success does not necessarily translate into a victory for feminism in Japan  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. Her opposition to key gender equality measures means that her premiership may do little to advance the cause of women's rights and could even be seen as a setback by some.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>International Implications: A More Assertive Foreign Policy</h3>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi's leadership is expected to herald a more assertive and nationalist foreign policy for Japan, which will have significant implications for the Indo-Pacific region and beyond  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. Her "Japan First" approach and her hawkish stance on security issues are likely to lead to a more robust and independent defence posture.</p>
            <p>The U.S.-Japan alliance is likely to remain the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy, but Takaichi's leadership may introduce new dynamics into the relationship  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. While she is a proponent of a strong security partnership, her willingness to challenge the U.S. on trade issues and her emphasis on Japanese autonomy could lead to a more transactional and less deferential relationship with Washington  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. Her ability to build a personal rapport with the U.S. president will be a key factor in managing this complex relationship  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Relations with China are likely to become more confrontational under Takaichi's leadership  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. Her hard-line stance on China's military expansion, her close ties with Taiwan, and her revisionist views on history are all potential sources of friction. Beijing is likely to view her premiership with suspicion and concern, and the risk of miscalculation and escalation in the East China Sea could increase.</p>
            <p>Similarly, relations with South Korea are poised for a difficult period  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. Takaichi's views on historical issues and her stance on the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute are likely to be met with strong opposition from Seoul. The recent progress in improving bilateral ties could be jeopardized, undermining trilateral cooperation between Japan, South Korea, and the United States.</p>
            <p>Takaichi's approach to international relations will be a delicate balancing act. She will need to project an image of a strong and resolute leader to her domestic audience, while also managing the diplomatic fallout from her more controversial positions. Her success in this endeavour will depend on her ability to temper her nationalist instincts with a pragmatic understanding of the realities of international politics.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The election of Sanae Takaichi as the president of the Liberal Democratic Party marks a pivotal moment in Japan's modern history. Her impending premiership, the first for a woman in the nation's history, is a testament to her political acumen and her ability to navigate the complex internal dynamics of the LDP. However, her victory is not simply a gender milestone; it represents a significant ideological shift, a doubling-down on the conservative and nationalist principles that have been gaining currency in Japanese politics over the past decade.</p>
            <p>Takaichi inherits a nation beset by a formidable array of challenges. A stagnant economy, a demographic crisis, a fractured political landscape, and a volatile international environment will all demand her immediate and sustained attention. Her policy prescriptions, a blend of Abenomics-style stimulus, a robust national security posture, and a staunch defence of traditional social values, are a clear indication of the direction in which she intends to lead Japan.</p>
            <p>Her leadership will undoubtedly be closely watched, both at home and abroad. Domestically, she will face the daunting task of uniting her party, restoring public trust, and addressing the deep-seated economic and social problems that have fuelled public discontent. Internationally, she will be challenged to manage complex and often fraught relationships with Japan's neighbours and its most important ally, the United States.</p>
            <p>The question of whether her premiership will be a transformative one remains to be seen. Will she be able to translate her vision of a "strong and prosperous" Japan into a tangible reality? Will her leadership usher in a new era of political stability and economic revitalisation, or will it deepen the divisions within Japanese society and exacerbate regional tensions? The answers to these questions will unfold in the months and years to come, but one thing is certain: the ascent of Sanae Takaichi has irrevocably altered the course of Japanese politics, and the consequences of her leadership will be felt for years to come.</p>
