            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article provides an in-depth examination of Hamas's response to the Gaza peace proposal put forth by then-United States President Donald Trump in September 2025. On October 3, 2025, Hamas announced its conditional agreement to key elements of the proposal, notably the release of all Israeli hostages and the transfer of Gaza's administration to a technocratic Palestinian body. However, the group stipulated that other aspects of the 20-point plan required further negotiation. This nuanced acceptance generated a complex international reaction, with President Trump calling for an immediate cessation of Israeli bombing and Prime Minister Netanyahu signalling a preparedness to proceed with initial phases. The article delves into the historical context of Israeli-Palestinian peace initiatives, the specific provisions of Trump's proposal, and the detailed breakdown of Hamas's acceptance and reservations. It analyses the immediate aftermath of the announcement, including the statements from key international figures and the ongoing diplomatic efforts to bridge the remaining divides. The piece aims to offer a comprehensive and objective overview of this pivotal moment in the Gaza conflict, exploring the potential pathways towards a resolution and the significant obstacles that persist.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The protracted conflict in the Gaza Strip has been a persistent source of regional and international concern for decades. Amidst the ongoing hostilities, various diplomatic efforts have been undertaken to achieve a lasting peace. One such significant initiative emerged in September 2025, when then-United States President Donald Trump unveiled a comprehensive 20-point peace proposal aimed at resolving the Gaza war and addressing broader Middle Eastern crises. This proposal, developed in close consultation with Israeli leadership, sought to establish a ceasefire, secure the release of hostages, dismantle Hamas's military capabilities, and implement a transitional governance structure in Gaza. The crux of this article lies in the reaction to this proposal by Hamas, a pivotal actor in the conflict. On October 3, 2025, Hamas issued a statement announcing its agreement to "parts" of the Trump plan, a development that was met with a mix of optimism and caution. While the group signalled a willingness to release all Israeli hostages and to transfer the administration of Gaza to a Palestinian body of independents, it also clearly stated that certain elements of the proposal necessitated further negotiation. This conditional acceptance immediately triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity, with President Trump urging Israel to halt its bombing campaign and Prime Minister Netanyahu indicating readiness to proceed with the initial stages of the plan. This article seeks to dissect Hamas's response in detail, examining the specific terms it accepted, the points it reserved for further discussion, and the broader implications of this development. It will explore the historical context of peace initiatives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the intricacies of Trump's 20-point plan, and the ensuing international reactions. By providing a thorough analysis of the events surrounding Hamas's conditional acceptance, this article aims to illuminate a critical juncture in the pursuit of peace in Gaza.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the most enduring and complex geopolitical issues of the modern era, with its roots deeply embedded in historical, religious, and territorial disputes that span over a century. The Gaza Strip, a densely populated Palestinian territory, has been a focal point of this conflict, experiencing repeated cycles of violence, occupation, and blockade. Understanding the context of Hamas's agreement to parts of the Trump peace proposal requires an appreciation of the historical trajectory of peace efforts, the evolving dynamics of the conflict, and the specific circumstances leading up to September 2025.</p>
            <p>Since the early 20th century, numerous attempts have been made to achieve a resolution, ranging from the Peel Commission's partition plan in 1937 to the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. These initiatives, while sometimes achieving temporary breakthroughs, have largely failed to establish a sustainable and just peace [Ref: 28]. The Oslo Accords, in particular, aimed to create a framework for a two-state solution, with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. However, the accords were plagued by implementation challenges, a lack of trust between the parties, and ongoing violence, ultimately failing to reach a final agreement [Ref: 28].</p>
            <p>Following the collapse of the Oslo process, the situation in Gaza became increasingly fraught. Hamas, designated as a terrorist organisation by several countries, gained significant political and military influence, culminating in its takeover of Gaza in 2007 after a conflict with Fatah [Ref: 8]. Israel responded with a blockade on Gaza, which has had severe humanitarian and economic consequences for the Palestinian population [Ref: 13]. The ensuing years saw multiple escalations of violence between Israel and Hamas, including major conflicts in 2008-09, 2012, 2014, and a prolonged war that began in October 2023 [Ref: 8, 17].</p>
            <p>In February 2025, a different Gaza Strip proposal by Donald Trump had been presented, but it was distinct from the September 2025 plan [Ref: 8]. The failure of previous peace efforts, coupled with the devastating impact of the ongoing war since October 7, 2023, created a pressing need for a new diplomatic initiative. This backdrop set the stage for President Trump's announcement of a new 20-point peace plan on September 29, 2025, at a press conference in the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [Ref: 8, 11]. This plan was presented as a comprehensive strategy to end the Gaza war, secure the release of hostages, dismantle Hamas, and establish a new governance structure for Gaza [Ref: 8].</p>
            <p>Trump's proposal was distinct from earlier initiatives in its specific provisions and the perceived leverage it aimed to exert. It called for an immediate ceasefire, the return of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the destruction of Hamas's military capabilities, and the establishment of a transitional governance structure led by Palestinian technocrats under international supervision [Ref: 8, 11]. The plan also envisioned a "deradicalised terror-free zone" in Gaza, redeveloped for the benefit of its people, with a conditional pathway toward Palestinian statehood [Ref: 8, 11]. The proposal was met with support from numerous countries, including France, Germany, Russia, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom [Ref: 8].</p>
            <p>However, the plan's success was contingent on Hamas's approval, and Trump set a deadline of October 5, 2025, for Hamas to accept the proposal, warning of severe consequences if they refused [Ref: 8]. This ultimatum added a layer of urgency to the already high-stakes negotiations. The subsequent response from Hamas on October 3, 2025, marked a critical moment, indicating a partial acceptance but also highlighting persistent disagreements, particularly concerning the extent of disarmament and the timeline for Israeli withdrawal [Ref: 4, 10]. This complex scenario, born from decades of unresolved conflict and recent escalations, forms the essential background for understanding the nuances of Hamas's conditional agreement.</p>

            <h2>The Trump Gaza Peace Proposal: Key Provisions</h2>
            <p>In September 2025, United States President Donald Trump unveiled a significant 20-point peace proposal aimed at resolving the protracted conflict in the Gaza Strip and fostering broader regional stability [Ref: 8, 11]. This plan, presented in collaboration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, represented a distinct approach to peace negotiations, deviating in several aspects from previous frameworks. The proposal was designed to address immediate concerns, such as the hostage crisis and ceasefire, while also laying out a vision for the future governance and reconstruction of Gaza [Ref: 8].</p>
            <p>At its core, the plan called for an immediate ceasefire, with all military operations suspended and frontlines frozen, contingent upon mutual agreement [Ref: 8, 11]. A central and urgent demand was the return of all Israeli hostages, both living and deceased, within 72 hours of acceptance [Ref: 8, 11]. In exchange for the hostages, Israel was to release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners: 250 serving life sentences and 1,700 detained after the October 7, 2023 attacks [Ref: 4, 11]. The proposal also included a specific provision for the remains of deceased hostages, stipulating that for every Israeli hostage whose remains were released, Israel would release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans [Ref: 8, 11].</p>
            <p>A critical component of the plan involved the future governance of Gaza. The proposal envisioned Gaza as a "deradicalised terror-free zone" that would not pose a threat to its neighbours [Ref: 8, 11]. It stipulated that Hamas and other factions would have no role in the governance of Gaza, either directly or indirectly [Ref: 11, 13]. Instead, the administration of the Strip was to be handed over to a "Palestinian body of independents (technocrats)," formed based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties [Ref: 4, 5, 11]. This body would be tasked with redevelopment and governance, operating under international supervision, potentially through a temporary "International Stabilization Force" (ISF) backed by Arab states [Ref: 11, 15]. The plan also proposed an "economic zone" with preferential trade access and encouraged efforts to build a prosperous economy and foster peaceful coexistence [Ref: 11].</p>
            <p>The plan also addressed security arrangements, calling for the destruction and non-rebuilding of all military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities [Ref: 11, 24]. While the immediate focus was on a ceasefire and hostage release, the proposal also outlined a potential "pathway to statehood" through a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a "political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence" [Ref: 8, 11, 30]. However, it was noted that the plan did not provide a clear pathway for reunification with the West Bank and explicitly ruled out Israeli annexation of Gaza [Ref: 11, 20, 29].</p>
            <p>Crucially, the plan also offered amnesty to Hamas members who committed to peaceful coexistence and decommissioned their weapons, with safe passage provided for those wishing to leave Gaza [Ref: 11]. Upon acceptance of the agreement, substantial humanitarian aid was to be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip, with plans for large-scale reconstruction [Ref: 8, 11]. The proposal was presented as a comprehensive package, with President Trump himself set to chair a "Board of Peace" as part of the transitional governing body [Ref: 13, 30]. The success of the plan was explicitly stated to be contingent on Hamas's approval [Ref: 8].</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Hamas's Response: Acceptance and Reservations</h2>
            <p>On October 3, 2025, Hamas released a statement detailing its response to President Donald Trump's 20-point peace proposal. This response was characterised by a conditional acceptance, agreeing to several key aspects of the plan while reserving others for further negotiation [Ref: 4, 5, 6, 10]. The group's announcement marked a significant development in the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the conflict and secure the release of hostages [Ref: 4, 7].</p>
            <p>Hamas explicitly agreed to the release of all Israeli hostages, both living and deceased, "in accordance with the exchange formula set forth in President Trump's proposal" [Ref: 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 27]. This was a central demand of the Trump plan and its acceptance by Hamas was viewed as a crucial step forward. The group also indicated its willingness to "hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and with the support of Arab and Islamic parties" [Ref: 4, 5, 10, 27]. This aligned with the Trump proposal's vision of a non-Hamas governance structure for Gaza.</p>
            <p>However, Hamas's acceptance was not unqualified. The group stated that "other portions of the deal should be subject to negotiation" [Ref: 4, 5, 6]. Specifically, key areas that Hamas indicated required further discussion included the comprehensive disarmament of the organisation, the timeline for Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza, and the broader future governance and rights of the Palestinian people [Ref: 4, 10, 16, 21, 25, 26]. Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk stated that Hamas would not disarm before the Israeli occupation ended and that issues concerning Gaza's future should be discussed within a comprehensive Palestinian national framework in which Hamas would be included [Ref: 16, 21]. There were also concerns raised about the feasibility of releasing all captives within the proposed 72-hour timeframe, with some Hamas officials deeming it "unrealistic" [Ref: 10, 25].</p>
            <p>The response also highlighted internal divisions within Hamas. While senior political officials reportedly supported the US deal, officials within Gaza were reportedly less eager to end the war on Trump's terms [Ref: 22]. Some critics within Hamas viewed the proposal more as a "72-hour truce" rather than a genuine peace agreement [Ref: 22]. Furthermore, some mediators expressed concerns that Hamas commanders might not be able to enforce disarmament, as some fighters might resist handing over their weapons [Ref: 22].</p>
            <p>Despite these reservations and complexities, the overall tone of Hamas's statement was one of conditional willingness to engage. The group expressed appreciation for the efforts of President Trump and other mediators, signalling a readiness to enter negotiations to "discuss the details" of the exchange and the broader framework [Ref: 9, 10, 15, 16, 27]. This nuanced position set the stage for subsequent diplomatic efforts to bridge the remaining gaps and move towards a more definitive resolution.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>International Reactions and Diplomatic Efforts</h2>
            <p>The announcement of Hamas's conditional acceptance of the Trump peace proposal on October 3, 2025, elicited a swift and varied range of international reactions, underscoring the complex geopolitical landscape surrounding the Gaza conflict [Ref: 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27]. Key international actors, including the United States, Israel, and regional mediators, responded to the development, setting in motion a new phase of diplomatic engagement.</p>
            <p>President Donald Trump, upon receiving Hamas's statement, expressed a positive outlook, stating on his Truth Social platform that he believed the group was "ready for a lasting PEACE" [Ref: 4, 7, 10, 18, 20, 23, 26]. Significantly, Trump also issued a direct call to Israel: "Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!" [Ref: 4, 7, 16, 20, 23]. He emphasised that discussions on the details were already underway, framing the situation not just as a Gaza issue but as part of a broader pursuit of peace in the Middle East [Ref: 16, 23]. Trump also extended his gratitude to several countries, including Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan, for their assistance in facilitating the dialogue [Ref: 19].</p>
            <p>The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also reacted with a degree of preparedness. Netanyahu's office released a statement early on October 4, 2025, indicating that "Israel is preparing to immediately implement the first phase of Trump's plan for the immediate release of all hostages" [Ref: 4, 7, 12, 19, 26]. The statement stressed continued cooperation with President Trump and his team to end the war in accordance with Israel's principles, consistent with Trump's vision [Ref: 4, 19]. However, it was also noted that Israel paused its ground offensive in Gaza City, with officials stating it was a "reduction in the level of fire" to allow Hamas fighters to organise the hostages, rather than a full ceasefire [Ref: 26]. Reports indicated that Israeli security officials had begun compiling lists of Palestinian prisoners for potential release and that negotiators were drawing maps for Israel's withdrawal, although the exact dimensions and timeline remained points of contention [Ref: 25].</p>
            <p>Regional mediators played a crucial role in facilitating the negotiations and responding to the developments. Egypt and Qatar, key players in previous ceasefire talks, expressed their welcome and commitment to continuing mediation efforts [Ref: 18, 26]. A senior Egyptian official indicated that talks were underway for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and that Arab mediators were preparing for comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians [Ref: 4]. Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed Hamas's announcement and confirmed the commencement of discussions with mediators to ensure an end to the war [Ref: 12].</p>
            <p>The United Nations also weighed in, with UN Secretary-General António Guterres welcoming and expressing encouragement over Hamas's statement. A UN spokesperson stated that Guterres urged all parties to seize the opportunity to end the conflict and thanked Qatar, Egypt, and the US for their mediation work [Ref: 18]. The UN chief reiterated his calls for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and unfettered humanitarian access [Ref: 18].</p>
            <p>Other international bodies and nations also responded. European governments, including France and the UK, expressed support for the potential breakthrough [Ref: 10]. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that the "release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach," while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Hamas's response "a significant step forwards" [Ref: 10]. Several Muslim-majority nations also issued joint statements welcoming the initiative [Ref: 9].</p>
            <p>Despite the initial positive reactions and diplomatic momentum, significant challenges remained. The differing interpretations of the plan, particularly regarding Hamas's disarmament and the extent of Israeli withdrawal, indicated that the path to a final resolution would be complex and require further intensive negotiations [Ref: 10, 12, 25, 26]. The involvement of figures like Jared Kushner and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in upcoming talks in Egypt highlighted the continued high-level diplomatic engagement aimed at bridging these divides [Ref: 4].</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Disagreements and Potential Obstacles</h2>
            <p>While Hamas's conditional acceptance of the Trump peace proposal in October 2025 represented a significant development, several key points of contention and potential obstacles remained, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the prospects for a lasting resolution [Ref: 4, 10, 12, 16, 25, 26]. The nuanced nature of Hamas's response indicated that the path to peace would be arduous, fraught with deep-seated disagreements and complex implementation challenges.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent areas of divergence was the issue of Hamas's disarmament. The Trump plan explicitly called for the dismantling of Hamas's military capabilities and the destruction of its infrastructure [Ref: 8, 11]. However, Hamas's response did not directly address this demand. Senior Hamas officials, such as Mousa Abu Marzouk, stated that the group would not disarm before the Israeli occupation ended and that issues related to its arms should be discussed within a broader Palestinian national framework [Ref: 16, 21]. This stance presented a significant hurdle, as disarmament was a core Israeli demand and a central tenet of the Trump proposal [Ref: 8, 24]. The resistance to full disarmament highlighted Hamas's determination to maintain its armed capacity, which Israel viewed as an existential threat [Ref: 24].</p>
            <p>The timeline and extent of the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza also emerged as a contentious point. While the Trump plan outlined a phased withdrawal, the specifics remained undefined and open to interpretation [Ref: 8, 10, 25]. Hamas signalled a desire for firmer commitments from Israel regarding this withdrawal, suggesting it was a prerequisite for the complete release of hostages [Ref: 26]. Israel, on the other hand, expressed a desire to ensure Hamas's disarmament and overall security in Gaza before concluding its withdrawal [Ref: 26]. This discrepancy in expectations regarding the sequencing and scope of Israeli military actions created a significant point of negotiation.</p>
            <p>The future governance of Gaza was another area where differences persisted. While Hamas agreed to transfer administration to a body of technocrats, it also insisted that issues concerning Gaza's future and Palestinian rights should be discussed within a comprehensive Palestinian national framework, implying a continued role for Hamas in some capacity [Ref: 4, 5, 16, 21]. This contrasted with Trump's vision of a complete exclusion of Hamas from governance [Ref: 11, 13, 30]. The formation of this technocratic government, its legitimacy, and its relationship with existing Palestinian political structures, including Hamas, presented a complex challenge.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the practicality of the proposed 72-hour timeline for the release of all hostages was questioned by some within Hamas, who deemed it "unrealistic" [Ref: 10, 25]. While Israel indicated it would show understanding regarding technical issues, the adherence to this strict deadline was seen as a potential point of failure [Ref: 25]. The conditionality attached to the hostage release, particularly the requirement for "field conditions necessary for the exchange," also introduced an element of ambiguity that could be exploited or lead to disputes [Ref: 5, 9, 12].</p>
            <p>Internal divisions within Hamas itself posed a significant obstacle. Reports indicated a rift between political leaders favouring the deal and those within Gaza who were more reluctant to end the war on Trump's terms [Ref: 22]. This internal discord could complicate Hamas's ability to fully commit to and implement any agreement reached. Mediators also voiced concerns that Hamas commanders might struggle to enforce disarmament among their fighters, who might resist relinquishing their weapons [Ref: 22].</p>
            <p>Beyond these specific points, the broader context of mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as the political pressures faced by leaders on both sides, added further complexity. Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, dominated by far-right factions, had expressed reservations about deals that did not guarantee Hamas's complete dismantling [Ref: 21]. Conversely, the militant nature of Hamas and its past actions made it difficult for Israel and the international community to fully trust its commitment to a peaceful resolution. The plan's lack of a clear pathway towards Palestinian statehood and its emphasis on Israeli security concerns were also points of criticism from some Palestinian perspectives [Ref: 13, 29].</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the success of the Trump peace proposal hinged on the ability of all parties to navigate these significant disagreements and to find common ground on issues such as disarmament, withdrawal, governance, and the timeline for implementation. The journey from conditional acceptance to a sustainable peace agreement was clearly one that required sustained diplomatic effort and a willingness to compromise.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The announcement by Hamas on October 3, 2025, that it had agreed to "parts" of the Gaza peace proposal outlined by then-President Donald Trump marked a pivotal moment in the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This conditional acceptance, which included agreement on the release of all Israeli hostages and the transfer of Gaza's administration to a technocratic Palestinian body, offered a glimmer of hope for de-escalation and a potential end to the protracted hostilities. However, as this article has detailed, the path forward remained fraught with significant challenges and points of contention.</p>
            <p>Hamas's reservations regarding the disarmament of its forces, the precise timeline and extent of an Israeli military withdrawal, and its own future role in Palestinian governance underscored the complex realities on the ground. These issues, coupled with potential internal divisions within Hamas and the overarching lack of trust between the parties, presented formidable obstacles to a comprehensive and lasting peace.</p>
            <p>The international community, including the United States, regional mediators, and global bodies, responded with a mixture of cautious optimism and a commitment to continued diplomatic engagement. President Trump's call for Israel to halt its bombing campaign and Prime Minister Netanyahu's indication of readiness to proceed with initial stages of the plan demonstrated a shared, albeit distinct, impetus to move forward. Yet, the critical need for further negotiations to bridge the gaps in understanding and commitment remained paramount.</p>
            <p>The Trump peace proposal, with its 20-point framework, attempted to address immediate humanitarian concerns and security demands while also outlining a vision for Gaza's future. While it garnered support from various international actors, its ultimate success depended on the willingness of all parties, particularly Hamas and Israel, to translate conditional agreements into concrete actions and to navigate the intricate details of implementation. The events of October 2025 served as a critical juncture, highlighting both the possibilities for peace and the deeply entrenched complexities that continue to define the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The journey towards a sustainable resolution would undoubtedly require sustained diplomatic effort, mutual concessions, and a genuine commitment to a future of peace and security for all.</p>
