            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article provides a detailed academic examination of the second week of the 2025 series of the British Broadcasting Corporation's popular dance competition, 'Strictly Come Dancing'. It meticulously analyses the leaderboard, the judges' scores, and the individual performances of the celebrity contestants and their professional partners. The paper delves into the emotional and physical challenges faced by the participants, offering specific case studies of Vicky Pattison's cathartic Foxtrot, Karen Carney's courageous Tango while managing a pre-existing spinal condition, and Thomas Skinner's divisive Salsa. Furthermore, it contextualises these events within the broader history and format of the programme, providing a scholarly yet accessible overview of this cultural phenomenon. By synthesising information from reputable news sources, this article aims to present an objective and thorough account of the pivotal second week of the competition, which saw the first public vote and the looming threat of elimination.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>'Strictly Come Dancing', a cornerstone of British television, has for over two decades captivated audiences with its blend of celebrity endeavour, professional dance artistry, and the inherent drama of live competition  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. The 2025 series, the twenty-third iteration of the programme, continued this tradition, presenting a new cohort of famous personalities to the nation, each embarking on a transformative journey from novice to ballroom aficionado  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The second week of the competition, which aired on the 4th of October 2025, represents a critical juncture in the series' narrative arc  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. It is the point at which the initial novelty gives way to the serious business of competition, as the judges' scores from the first week are combined with those of the second, and the public are invited to cast their votes for the first time  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. This confluence of judicial assessment and popular opinion determines which two couples will face the dreaded dance-off, and ultimately, who will be the first to depart the competition  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. This article will provide a comprehensive and scholarly analysis of this pivotal week, examining the performances, the scores, and the stories that unfolded on and off the dance floor. It will offer a detailed breakdown of the leaderboard, exploring the ascents and descents of the celebrity contestants, and will scrutinise the judges' critiques to understand the criteria for success in the competition. Furthermore, it will explore the human element of the show, focusing on the emotional and physical challenges that contestants face.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>To fully appreciate the significance of the second week's events, it is necessary to understand the foundational elements of 'Strictly Come Dancing'. The programme's format, which has been successfully exported to over 60 countries under the title 'Dancing with the Stars', pairs celebrities with professional dancers who then compete in a variety of ballroom and Latin dance styles  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. Each week, the couples perform a choreographed routine which is then scored by a panel of four expert judges  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. In the 2025 series, this panel comprised Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas, and Anton Du Beke  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The judges award a score out of ten, resulting in a total score out of forty  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. From the second week onwards, the public vote is introduced, and the combined total of the judges' scores and the public vote determines the two lowest-scoring couples, who must then perform their routine again in a dance-off  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. The judges then decide which couple to save, with the head judge, Shirley Ballas, traditionally holding the casting vote in the event of a tie  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. However, a notable change for the 2025 series was the decision to alternate the judge with the casting vote, with Motsi Mabuse being revealed as having this responsibility for the first elimination  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The 2025 series commenced on the 20th of September with a launch show that introduced the celebrity contestants and their professional partners  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. The line-up was a diverse mix of personalities from the worlds of sport, entertainment, and social media  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. The first live show aired on the 27th of September, and while no-one was eliminated, the judges' scores provided an early indication of the potential frontrunners and those who would face a tougher journey in the competition  <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. Former England Lioness Karen Carney and her partner Carlos Gu soared to the top of the leaderboard with an impressive Jive, scoring 31 points  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. At the other end of the spectrum, television correspondent Ross King and his partner Jowita Przystal found themselves at the bottom with a score of 10  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. These initial scores were carried over to the second week, adding an extra layer of pressure on all the contestants  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

            <h3>Analysis of the Week Two Leaderboard and Performances</h3>
            <p>The second week of the competition saw a significant shift in the leaderboard, with some couples building on their initial success and others experiencing a dramatic change in fortune. At the culmination of the second live show, actress and singer Amber Davies and her partner Nikita Kuzmin topped the combined leaderboard with a total score of 56  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. Their Samba to 'Bam Bam' by Camila Cabello and Ed Sheeran in week two earned them 29 points, a testament to their consistency and technical proficiency  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Close behind were actor Lewis Cope and his partner Katya Jones, who finished with a combined score of 55  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The highest score of the night, however, belonged to actress Alex Kingston and her partner Johannes Radebe, who received 31 points for their Samba to 'La Bamba' by Connie Francis  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. This represented a remarkable improvement on their week one score of 21, and their performance was widely praised by the judges as one of the best Sambas seen on the show in a considerable time  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. Head judge Shirley Ballas lauded it as "one of the better sambas I've seen in a long time," while Anton Du Beke, a self-confessed Samba sceptic, declared it "brilliant"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. This surge up the leaderboard demonstrated the potential for rapid development within the competition.</p>
            <p>Another notable improvement was seen from 'EastEnders' actress Balvinder Sopal and her partner Julian Caillon, who performed the first Charleston of the series to 'Been Like This' by Meghan Trainor and T-Pain  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. They scored 30 points, a significant jump from their week one score of 17  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. The judges were effusive in their praise, with Craig Revel Horwood describing the dance as "gorgeous" and Shirley Ballas calling it "outstanding, spot-on"  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>In stark contrast to these successes, some contestants found the second week to be a more challenging experience. Karen Carney, the leader from week one, saw a dramatic drop in her score. Her Tango to 'Training Season' by Dua Lipa with partner Carlos Gu earned them just 20 points, a significant decrease from their initial 31  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. This placed them in a more precarious position on the combined leaderboard than their initial performance would have suggested  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>At the bottom of the week two leaderboard was businessman and former 'Apprentice' contestant Thomas Skinner, who, with his partner Amy Dowden, performed a Salsa to 'Bonkers' by Dizzee Rascal and Armand Van Helden  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. Their routine, which was heavily reliant on lifts, received a score of just 13 from the judges  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. Craig Revel Horwood likened the performance to a "weightlifting competition" and criticised the lack of "real hip rotation or fluidity"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. Motsi Mabuse diplomatically described it as "interesting," while Shirley Ballas acknowledged that Skinner "gave it a go"  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. Skinner himself admitted, "I ain't good at dancing, so I might as well do some lifting"  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. This performance and the accompanying score left him and Dowden in a vulnerable position heading into the public vote  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>The Emotional Landscape of the Competition</h3>
            <p>Beyond the technical aspects of the dances and the numerical scores, 'Strictly Come Dancing' is a profoundly emotional experience for its participants. The second week, with the first elimination looming, often heightens these emotional responses. A particularly poignant moment came from television personality Vicky Pattison, who was visibly moved to tears following her Foxtrot with partner Kai Widdrington to 'Rein Me In' by Sam Fender and Olivia Dean  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Pattison, who rose to fame on the reality television show 'Geordie Shore', has spoken openly about her desire to change public perception and make her family proud  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. Her early career was characterised by a party-girl image that she has since worked to move beyond  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. The Foxtrot, with its Geordie-themed music and backdrop of the Tyne Bridge, held a particular significance for her  <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. After receiving positive comments from the judges, including Shirley Ballas's suggestion that she could "go all the way," Pattison was overcome with emotion  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. In a post-dance interview with co-host Claudia Winkleman, she tearfully explained, "I haven't really done an awful lot of stuff to make the North East proud, especially at the start of my career, so it feels really nice to be able to turn a corner on Strictly and have all my family and friends watch us and maybe make them proud"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. This moment resonated with viewers and highlighted the personal journeys that often run parallel to the dance competition itself  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Another contestant who experienced a difficult emotional journey in week two was entertainment reporter Ross King. After finishing at the bottom of the leaderboard in week one, King admitted to feeling like the "poster boy for people who can't dance"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. This sentiment underscores the psychological pressure that the competition can exert on its participants, particularly those with no prior dance experience.</p>

            <h3>The Physical Demands and Challenges</h3>
            <p>The physical rigours of 'Strictly Come Dancing' are often underestimated. The intensive training schedules and the demanding nature of the choreography can take a toll on the contestants' bodies. In week two, the physical challenges faced by former footballer Karen Carney were brought to the forefront. Carney revealed that she has a spinal condition called Scheuermann's disease, which she has had since childhood and which results in a curved spine  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. This condition makes it "really hard" for her to achieve the open posture required for many ballroom dances, particularly the Tango  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Ahead of her performance, Carney explained, "There's certain elements I won't be able to do as well as I'd like to"  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. Her professional partner, Carlos Gu, elaborated, stating that her spine is "curved in, so she can't fully open"  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. Despite using a posture aid in training, Carney's condition impacted her Tango, and the judges' comments focused on her "closed in" posture and the need for a "wide frame"  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. Motsi Mabuse acknowledged the challenge, stating, "It's going to be something we need to challenge to stretch and open up. There's a certain ballroom posture that we need"  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. Some viewers expressed concern that the judges' critiques could be perceived as ableist, given Carney's condition  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. Carney, however, responded with the resilience of a professional athlete, stating that she was used to constructive criticism and was determined to improve  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. Her situation highlighted the unseen battles that contestants may be fighting and the immense dedication required to compete.</p>
            <p>The physical demands of the competition were also evident in the performance of Thomas Skinner. While his Salsa was criticised for its lack of dance content, the numerous lifts he executed demonstrated considerable strength  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. However, as the judges pointed out, strength alone is not sufficient for success in 'Strictly Come Dancing'. The incident also brought into focus the health of professional dancer Amy Dowden, who had been feeling "under the weather" in the lead-up to the live show but still performed the lift-packed routine  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The second week of 'Strictly Come Dancing' 2025 was a compelling chapter in the series, marked by a dynamic leaderboard, emotional revelations, and the stark reality of the competition's physical demands. The ascent of Alex Kingston and Balvinder Sopal demonstrated the potential for significant improvement and the fluid nature of the contest. The consistency of Amber Davies and Lewis Cope established them as early frontrunners, while the struggles of Karen Carney and Thomas Skinner illustrated the diverse challenges that the contestants face.</p>
            <p>Vicky Pattison's emotional response to her performance provided a powerful reminder of the personal narratives that underpin the glitter and glamour of the show. Her desire to redefine her public image and make her loved ones proud is a theme that resonates with many viewers and adds a layer of depth to the competition. Similarly, Karen Carney's openness about her spinal condition brought to light the unseen physical hurdles that some contestants must overcome.</p>
            <p>As the first public vote loomed, the leaderboard after week two set the stage for a tense results show. The combination of the judges' scores and the viewers' votes would ultimately decide the fate of the two couples who would have to dance for their survival. The events of this pivotal week not only reshaped the competition but also reinforced 'Strictly Come Dancing's' enduring appeal as a multifaceted spectacle that combines athleticism, artistry, and compelling human drama.</p>
