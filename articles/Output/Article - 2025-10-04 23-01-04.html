            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>On the 4th of October 2025, a Russian drone strike targeted the railway station in Shostka, a city in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, hitting two passenger trains  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. The attack resulted in the death of a 71-year-old man and injured approximately 30 other individuals, including children  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned the attack as a deliberate act of terrorism against civilians  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. This incident is not an isolated event but rather emblematic of a broader and escalating Russian strategy of targeting Ukraine's critical infrastructure, with the railway network being a primary focus  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This article will provide a detailed and in-depth analysis of the Shostka train attack, placing it within the wider military, legal, and humanitarian dimensions of the Russo-Ukrainian War. It will argue that the attack on the Shostka railway station represents a clear example of the weaponisation of civilian infrastructure, a tactic with profound implications for the conduct of modern warfare and the protection of non-combatants.</p>
            <p>The article will be structured as follows: First, it will provide a detailed account of the Shostka train attack, drawing on available reports to reconstruct the event. Second, it will offer a comprehensive background to the targeting of Ukraine's railway infrastructure, highlighting the strategic importance of Ukrzaliznytsia (Ukrainian Railways) since the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Third, the article will undertake a thorough examination of the attack through the lens of international humanitarian law, with a particular focus on the principles of distinction, proportionality, and the legal complexities surrounding 'dual-use' infrastructure. This section will also analyse the 'double-tap' tactic employed in the attack, a method that raises grave concerns about the deliberate targeting of civilians and first responders.</p>
            <p>Fourth, the article will explore the technological aspects of the attack, considering the evolution of drone warfare in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. Fifth, it will assess the broader humanitarian, socio-economic, and political ramifications of the sustained attacks on Ukraine's railway network. Finally, the conclusion will synthesise the key findings and reflect on the challenges that the weaponisation of infrastructure poses to the international legal and normative order. Through this multi-faceted analysis, this article aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of a critical and devastating aspect of the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

            <h3>Background: The Strategic Significance of Ukrainian Railways and the Pattern of Russian Attacks</h3>
            <p>The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which commenced on the 24th of February 2022, has been characterised by widespread and systematic attacks on civilian infrastructure  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. While the initial phases of the war saw a rapid advance of Russian forces, the conflict soon evolved into a war of attrition, in which the ability to sustain military operations and maintain the resilience of the state became paramount. In this context, Ukraine's extensive railway network, operated by the state-owned company Ukrzaliznytsia, has emerged as a critical lifeline for the nation, earning it the moniker of Ukraine's "second army"  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>From the outset of the invasion, Ukrainian Railways played a pivotal role in one of the largest civilian evacuations in recent European history. With Ukrainian airspace closed to civilian traffic, trains became the primary means of escape for millions of Ukrainians fleeing the advancing Russian forces  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. It is estimated that Ukrzaliznytsia was responsible for transporting more than half of the initial eight million people displaced by the conflict  <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. These evacuation trains, often running under perilous conditions and subject to attack, became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance and the determination to protect its civilian population.</p>
            <p>Beyond its humanitarian function, the railway network has been indispensable for Ukraine's war effort. It has served as the logistical backbone for the Ukrainian armed forces, facilitating the movement of troops, military hardware, and essential supplies to the front lines  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. The reliance of both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries on rail transport for logistical support underscores the strategic importance of controlling and disrupting these networks  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, with Ukraine's Black Sea ports largely blockaded or under threat, the railways have become a vital artery for the country's economy, enabling the export of grain and other goods to international markets  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. The adaptability of Ukrzaliznytsia in reorienting its freight operations westward has been crucial in mitigating the economic impact of the war. The railway has also played a significant diplomatic role, providing safe passage for numerous world leaders and international delegations visiting Kyiv, a testament to its operational resilience  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Recognising the critical importance of the railway network to Ukraine's survival and resistance, Russian forces have systematically and repeatedly targeted it since the beginning of the full-scale invasion  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. These attacks have taken various forms, including missile strikes, drone attacks, and the mining of railway tracks  <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. The objectives of this campaign appear to be multifaceted: to disrupt Ukrainian military logistics, to cripple the Ukrainian economy, and to terrorise the civilian population by making travel and daily life untenable  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The intensity and focus of these attacks have evolved throughout the conflict. Initially, there was an apparent attempt by Russian forces to capture and utilise the Ukrainian railway infrastructure for their own logistical purposes  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. However, as the war progressed and Russian territorial gains stalled, the strategy shifted towards the systematic destruction of railway infrastructure  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. This has included the targeting of railway stations, bridges, power substations that supply electricity to the rail network, and the trains themselves  <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. By November 2024, it was reported that at least 126 train stations and over 500 kilometres of track had been damaged due to daily attacks  <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. The financial cost of this destruction is substantial, with the total direct losses to Ukraine's railway infrastructure estimated at 4.3 billion US dollars  <sup><a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The human cost has also been significant. Railway workers have found themselves on the front line, risking their lives to repair damaged tracks and keep the trains running. By early 2025, hundreds of railway employees had been killed and many more injured in the line of duty  <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. The attack on the Kramatorsk railway station in April 2022, which killed over 60 civilians waiting to be evacuated, stands as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of these attacks on the civilian population  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The attack on the passenger trains in Shostka on the 4th of October 2025 is, therefore, not an anomaly but rather a continuation of a deliberate and sustained campaign to dismantle Ukraine's railway system. The choice of target—passenger trains at a station in a regional city—and the method of attack, a 'double-tap' strike, underscore the apparent disregard for civilian life and the intention to sow fear and disrupt the fabric of Ukrainian society.</p>

            <h3>The Shostka Railway Station Attack: A Detailed Examination</h3>
            <p>On the morning of the 4th of October 2025, the railway station in Shostka, Sumy Oblast, became the scene of a deadly attack that underscored the brutal realities of Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. At approximately 11:50 AM Kyiv time, a Russian drone struck a passenger train at the station  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. This initial attack was followed by a second strike minutes later, as passengers were being evacuated and emergency services were arriving at the scene  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. This 'double-tap' tactic, as it is commonly known, is particularly insidious as it often targets those who have come to the aid of the victims of the first strike  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The attack resulted in the death of a 71-year-old man, whose body was later discovered by rescuers in one of the damaged train carriages  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. Approximately 30 other individuals were injured, including a 44-year-old woman and her three sons, aged 14, 11, and 7  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. Among the injured were both passengers and employees of Ukrzaliznytsia  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The head of the local district administration, Oksana Tarasiuk, confirmed the number of injured and that they had been transported to hospital for treatment  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Two trains were damaged in the attack. The first was a local commuter service, the Tereshchynska–Novhorod-Siverskyi train  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The second was a train bound for the capital, Kyiv, the Kyiv–Shostka train  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The second strike reportedly hit the electric locomotive of the Kyiv-bound train while the evacuation was already underway  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. Video footage from the scene, shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, showed a passenger carriage engulfed in flames, with other carriages exhibiting shattered windows and significant damage  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The attack also caused power outages in Shostka and the surrounding areas  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian officials were swift and unequivocal in their condemnation of the attack. President Zelenskyy described it as a "savage Russian drone strike" and a deliberate act of terrorism  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. He emphasised that "The Russians could not have been unaware that they were striking civilians"  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also highlighted the use of the 'double-tap' tactic, calling it "one of the most brutal Russian tactics"  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The Sumy Regional Prosecutor's Office has opened criminal proceedings under the charge of war crimes resulting in the death of a person  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The head of Ukrzaliznytsia, Oleksandr Pertsovskyi, stated that the attack was a "cowardly attack aimed at stopping the connection with our frontline areas"  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. He further elaborated that there was no military purpose to the attack, and that its sole aim was to sow panic and make frontline and border areas uninhabitable  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The location of Shostka, approximately 50 kilometres from the Russian border, lends credence to this assertion, as it is situated in a region that has been subjected to frequent Russian attacks  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The international community also reacted to the attack. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the strike, stating that "The shocking scenes emerging from Shostka railway station highlight Russia's reckless and continued willingness to target civilians"  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Shostka railway station attack is a microcosm of the broader Russian strategy of targeting Ukraine's transport infrastructure. It demonstrates a clear intent to inflict civilian casualties, disrupt daily life, and undermine the morale of the Ukrainian population. The use of a 'double-tap' strike, in particular, points to a cynical and calculated disregard for the principles of international humanitarian law.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>International Humanitarian Law and the Shostka Attack</h3>
            <p>The attack on the passenger trains in Shostka raises profound questions regarding its legality under international humanitarian law (IHL), the body of rules that seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict. The core principles of IHL, particularly those of distinction, proportionality, and precaution, are central to any legal analysis of this incident.</p>
            <p>The principle of distinction, a cornerstone of IHL, requires parties to an armed conflict to distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. Attacks may only be directed against military objectives  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. A military objective is defined in Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions as an object which by its nature, location, purpose, or use makes an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralisation, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Ukrainian railway network, while serving a crucial civilian function, also has a clear military utility, transporting troops and military supplies. This 'dual-use' nature of the infrastructure complicates the application of the principle of distinction  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. However, the presence of a potential military use does not automatically render the entire railway system a legitimate military target  <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. The legal assessment must be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific circumstances of each attack.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Shostka attack, several factors suggest that the strike was a violation of the principle of distinction. The targets were passenger trains, one a local commuter service and the other a train to Kyiv, filled with civilians  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. Ukrainian officials have maintained that there was no military traffic at the station at the time of the attack  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. While Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, the burden of proof lies with the attacker to demonstrate that the object of the attack was a legitimate military objective. In the absence of such evidence, the deliberate targeting of passenger trains constitutes a grave breach of IHL and a war crime  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a>, <a href="#ref46">46</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Even if it were argued that the railway station or the locomotives had some military significance, the principle of proportionality would still apply. This principle prohibits attacks which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. Given that the attack resulted in the death of a civilian and the injury of some thirty others, including children, it is highly questionable whether any potential military advantage gained from destroying the locomotives of two passenger trains could be considered proportionate to the foreseeable harm to civilians  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The 'double-tap' tactic employed in the Shostka attack further exacerbates the legal concerns. This tactic, which involves a second strike on the same location shortly after the first, is particularly egregious as it often targets first responders and civilians who have come to the aid of the initial victims  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. International humanitarian law provides specific protection for medical personnel, humanitarian aid workers, and civil defence personnel. Deliberately targeting such individuals is a war crime  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The second strike in Shostka, which occurred during the evacuation of passengers, demonstrates a clear intent to maximise civilian casualties and to terrorise the population  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The principle of precaution, which requires parties to a conflict to take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to minimise, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects, was also evidently disregarded in the Shostka attack. This includes giving effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. There is no indication that any such warning was given before the strike on the Shostka railway station.</p>
            <p>The systematic and widespread nature of Russian attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, including the energy grid and transport networks, has been documented by numerous international bodies, including the United Nations and human rights organisations  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a>, <a href="#ref43">43</a></sup>. These attacks have been condemned as violations of IHL and potential war crimes. The Shostka train attack is a clear and tragic example of this pattern of unlawful conduct.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Evolving Technology of Terror: Drone Warfare in Ukraine</h3>
            <p>The attack on the Shostka railway station was carried out using drones, a technology that has become ubiquitous and increasingly sophisticated in the Russo-Ukrainian War  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. Both sides have extensively employed a wide array of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, and direct attacks, transforming the nature of the modern battlefield  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. Russia's use of drones in the Shostka attack highlights a tactical evolution towards more precise and relentless targeting of critical infrastructure.</p>
            <p>While the specific type of drone used in the Shostka attack has not been definitively identified in the available public reports, Russia has predominantly relied on several models for long-range strikes. These include the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 (and its Russian variant, the Geran-2), a 'kamikaze' or one-way attack drone known for its relatively low cost and ability to be deployed in large numbers to overwhelm air defences  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. The use of such drones allows Russia to sustain its campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of using more advanced cruise or ballistic missiles  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The war has spurred a rapid cycle of technological innovation and adaptation in drone warfare. Russia has been observed to be evolving its drone tactics, moving from uncoordinated daytime attacks to more sophisticated, simultaneous strikes designed to saturate air defences  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. There is also evidence of technical modifications to the drones themselves, such as improved navigation systems to counter Ukrainian electronic warfare measures and the integration of more powerful warheads  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The increasing precision of Russian drone strikes has been noted by Ukrainian officials, posing a growing challenge to the country's defence forces  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The attack on the locomotives in Shostka suggests a deliberate targeting of a specific component of the railway system. This may indicate the use of drones with advanced targeting capabilities, possibly incorporating artificial intelligence or machine learning for object recognition  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The ability to specifically target locomotives, the motive power of the trains, is a more efficient way to disrupt the railway network than simply damaging the tracks, which can often be repaired relatively quickly.</p>
            <p>The 'double-tap' tactic employed in Shostka is also facilitated by the use of drones. A reconnaissance drone can be used to monitor the target after the initial strike, providing real-time intelligence for the second attack. This allows the attackers to time the second strike to coincide with the arrival of first responders, maximising its deadly impact  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Ukraine, for its part, has also developed a formidable domestic drone industry and has been highly effective in using drones for both defensive and offensive operations  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. This has created a "direct technological race" between the two sides, with each constantly seeking to gain an advantage through innovation  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The use of drones to attack civilian infrastructure, as seen in Shostka, represents a low-cost, high-impact form of modern warfare. It allows for the sustained and systematic degradation of a country's vital systems, with profound consequences for the civilian population. The psychological impact of such attacks, which can occur at any time and in any place, should not be underestimated. The constant threat of drone strikes contributes to a climate of fear and uncertainty, which is a key objective of a strategy of terror.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Ripple Effect: Humanitarian, Socio-Economic, and Political Consequences</h3>
            <p>The drone attack on the Shostka railway station, while a localised event, is part of a broader campaign against Ukraine's infrastructure that has far-reaching and devastating consequences. These consequences are not limited to the immediate casualties and physical damage but extend to the humanitarian, socio-economic, and political spheres, impacting the lives of millions of Ukrainians and posing significant challenges to the country's long-term recovery.</p>
            <p>The most immediate humanitarian consequence of attacks on the railway system is the direct threat to civilian lives. The death and injuries in Shostka are a tragic reminder of this  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. Beyond the immediate casualties, the disruption of the railway network impedes the evacuation of civilians from frontline areas and the delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. For many Ukrainians, particularly those in the east and south of the country, trains represent the only safe means of escape from the fighting. By targeting this vital escape route, Russia is effectively trapping civilians in conflict zones, exposing them to further harm.</p>
            <p>The socio-economic impact of the attacks on Ukraine's railways is equally severe. The railway is the backbone of the Ukrainian economy, and its disruption has a cascading effect on various sectors  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. The blockade of Black Sea ports has made rail the primary route for exporting Ukrainian grain, a critical source of revenue for the country and a vital component of global food security  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. Attacks on the railway network directly threaten these exports, exacerbating Ukraine's economic woes and contributing to global food price volatility.</p>
            <p>Domestically, the disruption of passenger and freight services has a profound impact on daily life. It hinders the movement of people, goods, and services, isolating communities and making it difficult for businesses to operate  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. The damage to railway infrastructure also imposes a significant financial burden on the Ukrainian state, diverting scarce resources from other essential services to the constant repair and reconstruction of the network  <sup><a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>. The long-term cost of rebuilding Ukraine's transport infrastructure is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The political consequences of the attacks are also significant. The deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure is a clear violation of international law and serves to further isolate Russia on the international stage. Such attacks strengthen the resolve of the Ukrainian people and their government to resist the Russian aggression  <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. They also galvanise international support for Ukraine, leading to increased military and financial assistance and the imposition of further sanctions on Russia  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The attack on Shostka, and the broader campaign against Ukraine's infrastructure, is a clear attempt to demoralise the Ukrainian population and to pressure the government into submission. However, the evidence suggests that this strategy is having the opposite effect, reinforcing Ukrainian national identity and the determination to defend their sovereignty.</p>
            <p>The resilience of the Ukrainian people and the remarkable efforts of the country's railway workers to keep the trains running in the face of constant attacks are a testament to the nation's spirit  <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. Nevertheless, the long-term impact of the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure will be a major challenge for the country's post-war recovery and will require a concerted and sustained international effort to rebuild.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The drone attack on the passenger trains at the Shostka railway station on the 4th of October 2025, is a stark and tragic illustration of the brutal realities of the Russo-Ukrainian War. It is not merely an isolated incident of violence but a calculated act within a broader strategy of weaponising civilian infrastructure. This article has sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of this attack, placing it within its strategic, legal, technological, and humanitarian contexts.</p>
            <p>The evidence strongly suggests that the attack on the Shostka trains was a deliberate act of aggression against civilians, in clear violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. The use of a 'double-tap' strike, targeting those who had come to the aid of the initial victims, is particularly reprehensible and points to an intent to maximise civilian casualties and to sow terror.</p>
            <p>The sustained and systematic targeting of Ukraine's railway network is a central component of Russia's war strategy. Ukrzaliznytsia has proven to be a vital artery for Ukraine, facilitating the evacuation of millions, sustaining the country's war effort, and keeping its economy afloat. By attacking this critical infrastructure, Russia aims to achieve multiple objectives: to disrupt Ukrainian military logistics, to cripple the economy, and to break the will of the Ukrainian people.</p>
            <p>The evolution of drone technology has enabled this campaign of infrastructure degradation to be carried out with increasing precision and lethality. The war in Ukraine has become a laboratory for the development and deployment of new forms of warfare, with profound implications for the future of conflict.</p>
            <p>The humanitarian and socio-economic consequences of these attacks are immense. They inflict not only immediate death and injury but also long-term suffering, disrupting daily life, impeding economic activity, and creating a climate of fear and uncertainty. The resilience of the Ukrainian people and the dedication of its railway workers are a powerful counter-narrative to this strategy of terror, but the challenges of reconstruction will be immense.</p>
            <p>The Shostka train attack, and the countless other attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, pose a grave challenge to the international legal and normative order. They underscore the urgent need for accountability for war crimes and for a renewed commitment to the protection of civilians in armed conflict. The failure to hold perpetrators to account will only embolden those who seek to use the weaponisation of infrastructure as a tool of modern warfare. The international community must not only support Ukraine in its immediate defence and recovery but also work to strengthen the mechanisms of international law to prevent such atrocities from happening in the future.</p>
