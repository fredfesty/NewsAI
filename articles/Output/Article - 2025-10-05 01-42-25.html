            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the federal court's decision to temporarily block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon. It delves into the multifaceted legal and constitutional questions that arose from this significant confrontation between federal and state authorities. The central focus is the temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut, which is meticulously examined within the broader context of American legal and political history. The article explores the historical precedents for the domestic deployment of federal troops, the intricate legal framework governing such actions, including the Insurrection Act of 1807 and the Posse Comatus Act of 1878, and the evolving role of the Department of Homeland Security in domestic law enforcement. Through a detailed dissection of the events in Portland, the legal arguments presented by both the state of Oregon and the federal government, and the court's reasoning, this article illuminates the delicate balance between federal power and state sovereignty, the judicial scrutiny of executive authority, and the profound implications of these events for the future of civil liberties and the rule of law in the United States. It maintains a politically objective stance, providing a scholarly and dispassionate inquiry into a moment of significant constitutional tension.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The summer of 2020 witnessed a period of profound civil unrest across the United States, catalysed by the death of George Floyd. Among the cities that became epicentres of sustained protest was Portland, Oregon. The demonstrations in Portland, while largely peaceful, were also characterised by instances of property damage and confrontations with law enforcement. It was against this backdrop of protracted protest that the Trump administration escalated the federal government's presence in the city, a move that culminated in a significant legal and constitutional standoff. This article will provide an exhaustive examination of a pivotal moment in this confrontation: the decision by a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order, thereby blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Portland  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This judicial intervention brought to the fore fundamental questions concerning the division of power between the federal government and the states, the permissible use of military force for domestic law enforcement, and the role of the judiciary in checking executive power. The events in Portland were not merely a localised dispute but rather a national focal point for a debate over the very nature of American federalism and the constitutional limits on presidential authority.</p>
            <p>This article will proceed by first establishing the historical and legal background of federal intervention within the United States, providing the necessary context to understand the gravity of the situation in Portland. It will then delve into the specifics of the 2020 Portland protests, tracing their evolution and the factors that led to the increased federal presence. A significant portion of the analysis will be dedicated to the escalation of federal involvement, the controversies that ensued, and the legal challenges that were mounted in response. The core of the article will be a detailed examination of the judicial scrutiny of the executive's actions, with a particular focus on the legal reasoning behind the temporary restraining order. Finally, the broader implications and potential precedents of this case will be explored, offering a comprehensive understanding of its significance in the annals of American constitutional law.</p>
            <p>The aim of this article is to provide a scholarly, detailed, and politically objective account of these events. It will eschew partisan rhetoric and instead focus on a meticulous analysis of the legal doctrines, historical precedents, and constitutional principles at play. Through this rigorous examination, the article seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of a critical juncture in the ongoing dialogue about the balance of power in the American system of governance.</p>

            <h3>Historical and Legal Background of Federal Intervention</h3>
            <p>The deployment of federal troops for domestic law enforcement purposes is a contentious issue with deep roots in American history and a complex legal framework governing its application. The foundational principles of the United States, particularly the concepts of federalism and the separation of powers, have created a system in which the use of military force within the nation's borders is subject to significant constraints. A thorough understanding of the historical context and the key legislative acts that shape this area of law is essential to appreciate the significance of the legal challenge that arose in Portland.</p>
            <p>The framers of the Constitution were deeply wary of a standing army and its potential for abuse. This apprehension is reflected in the carefully delineated powers granted to the federal government. The Constitution grants Congress the power to "provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions"  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. This clause provides the constitutional underpinning for the federal government's authority to use military force domestically, but it is an authority vested in the legislative branch, not the executive.</p>
            <p>Two key pieces of legislation, the Insurrection Act of 1807 and the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, have further shaped the legal landscape of domestic military intervention. The Insurrection Act empowers the President of the United States to deploy the U.S. military and federalise the National Guard within the country in specific circumstances, such as to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, or rebellion  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. Historically, the Act has been invoked in a variety of situations, from the enforcement of federal law during the Civil Rights Movement to the quelling of riots  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. For instance, President Dwight D. Eisenhower federalised the Arkansas National Guard in 1957 to enforce the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School, and President George H.W. Bush deployed federal troops during the 1992 Los Angeles riots at the request of the Governor of California  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Posse Comitatus Act, on the other hand, serves as a significant check on the domestic use of the military. The Act, passed in the aftermath of the Reconstruction era, generally prohibits the use of the U.S. Army (and by extension, the Air Force) for domestic law enforcement purposes unless expressly authorised by the Constitution or an Act of Congress  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. The Insurrection Act is one such congressional authorisation that provides an exception to the prohibitions of the Posse Comitatus Act  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. The relationship between these two acts is central to understanding the legal debates surrounding the deployment of federal forces in Portland. The National Guard, when operating under the command of a state governor, is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. However, once federalised by the President, its members are considered federal troops and are bound by the Act's restrictions, unless an exception, such as the Insurrection Act, is invoked  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which reserves to the states powers not delegated to the federal government, is also a critical component of this legal framework. State officials in Oregon argued that the unilateral deployment of federalised National Guard troops without the state's consent infringed upon its sovereignty and the police powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. This argument raises fundamental questions about the balance of power in the American federal system and the extent to which the federal government can intervene in matters traditionally considered to be within the purview of state and local authorities.</p>
            <p>The judiciary's role in adjudicating disputes over the domestic use of military force is also a complex and evolving area of law. Courts have often shown deference to the executive branch in matters of national security, a principle known as "national security deference"  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. This deference is rooted in the idea that the executive branch has superior expertise and access to information in such matters. However, the extent of this deference is not unlimited, and courts have also asserted their authority to review the legality of executive actions, particularly when fundamental constitutional rights are at stake  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. The case in Portland presented a direct challenge to the scope of this deference, forcing the court to weigh the executive's asserted authority against the constitutional principles of federalism and the separation of powers.</p>

            <h3>The 2020 Portland Protests: A Genesis of Conflict</h3>
            <p>The protests that erupted in Portland, Oregon, in the late spring of 2020 were part of a nationwide wave of demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. However, the protests in Portland soon developed their own distinct character, marked by their longevity and the intensity of the confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement. For over 100 consecutive nights, protestors gathered in the city's streets, their initial calls for racial justice and police accountability expanding to encompass a broader critique of systemic inequality and government authority  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The focal point of the nightly protests quickly became the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse, a federal building in downtown Portland  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. This choice of location was significant, as it brought the protestors into direct conflict with federal law enforcement agencies tasked with protecting federal property. The initial response to the protests was primarily from the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), which employed various crowd control measures, including the use of tear gas and impact munitions  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The nature of the protests was multifaceted. While a great number of participants engaged in peaceful demonstrations, a smaller contingent was involved in acts of vandalism, arson, and direct confrontations with law enforcement  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. This dynamic was often highlighted in media coverage, with different outlets framing the events in starkly different ways, contributing to a polarised national perception of the situation in Portland  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. Some media outlets focused on the peaceful aspects of the protests and the heavy-handed tactics of law enforcement, while others emphasised the violence and property destruction, often using terms like "riots" and "anarchy" to describe the events  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Trump administration's portrayal of the situation in Portland was particularly stark. President Trump and other administration officials repeatedly characterised the city as being "under siege" and overrun by "violent anarchists" and "domestic terrorists"  <sup><a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. This narrative was used to justify the administration's decision to deploy federal law enforcement agents to the city, a move that was framed as a necessary intervention to restore law and order in the face of what they alleged was a failure by state and local officials to control the situation  <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Local officials in Portland and the state of Oregon strongly contested this characterisation of the city and the necessity of federal intervention  <sup><a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. They argued that the federal presence was unwelcome and that it was actually escalating tensions and exacerbating the conflict  <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. They maintained that local law enforcement was capable of managing the protests and that the federal government's actions were a politically motivated overreach of its authority  <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The protests in Portland, therefore, became more than just a local issue. They evolved into a national symbol of the deep political and social divisions within the United States, a flashpoint for debates about race, policing, and the role of government, and the crucible in which a major constitutional confrontation between the federal government and a sovereign state would be forged. The events on the ground in Portland, with their complex interplay of peaceful protest, property destruction, and escalating law enforcement tactics, set the stage for the legal battles that would follow.</p>

            <h3>Escalation of Federal Presence and Subsequent Controversies</h3>
            <p>The Trump administration's response to the ongoing protests in Portland began to escalate significantly in July 2020 with the increased deployment of federal law enforcement agents to the city. These agents, drawn from various agencies under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), were ostensibly sent to protect federal property, primarily the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. However, their tactics and the scope of their operations quickly became a source of intense controversy and legal challenges.</p>
            <p>One of the most contentious aspects of the federal intervention was the use of unmarked vehicles and unidentified federal agents in camouflage uniforms to detain protestors on the streets of Portland, often far from federal property  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. These actions, which were widely documented in videos and eyewitness accounts, raised serious concerns about due process and the potential for an unaccountable federal police force operating in American cities. Civil liberties organisations and legal experts decried these tactics as reminiscent of those used by authoritarian regimes and a grave threat to the constitutional rights of citizens  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The federal agents also employed aggressive crowd control measures, including the widespread use of tear gas, pepper balls, and impact munitions against protestors  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. These tactics often resulted in injuries to demonstrators and journalists and created chaotic and violent scenes in the streets of downtown Portland. The use of such force by federal agents, particularly against largely peaceful protestors, was widely condemned by local officials and civil rights groups  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Department of Homeland Security defended its actions, asserting that its officers were facing a sustained and violent assault from a "mob" of anarchists and that their tactics were necessary to protect federal property and personnel  <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. The administration also argued that it had the legal authority to deploy federal agents to protect federal facilities, a claim that was not in itself disputed. However, it was the manner in which this authority was exercised, and the expansion of federal operations beyond the immediate vicinity of federal property, that became the central point of contention.</p>
            <p>The controversies surrounding the actions of federal agents in Portland led to a series of legal challenges. The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies, alleging that they had engaged in unlawful law enforcement activities that violated the civil rights of Oregonians  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also filed lawsuits on behalf of journalists and legal observers who had been targeted by federal agents  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>An internal review by the DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis later revealed that the department had compiled intelligence dossiers on protestors arrested in Portland, including information about their friends, family, and social media associates, even when there was little to no connection to domestic terrorism  <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. This revelation further fueled concerns about the overreach of federal surveillance and the targeting of individuals for exercising their First Amendment rights  <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The escalation of the federal presence in Portland and the controversial tactics employed by federal agents transformed the situation from a local protest into a national crisis. It raised fundamental questions about the role of the federal government in local law enforcement, the accountability of federal agents, and the protection of civil liberties in times of civil unrest. It was in this highly charged and legally fraught environment that the Trump administration announced its intention to deploy the National Guard to Portland, a move that would trigger a direct and immediate judicial intervention.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Judicial Scrutiny of Executive Action</h3>
            <p>The Trump administration's announcement that it intended to deploy the National Guard to Portland marked a significant escalation in the federal government's intervention in the city and prompted an immediate and forceful legal response from the state of Oregon and the city of Portland. On Sunday, September 28, 2025, the Department of Defense notified state officials that 200 members of the Oregon National Guard were being federalised and deployed to Portland for a period of 60 days to protect federal personnel and facilities  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. In response, the state and the city jointly filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the deployment, arguing that it was an unlawful and unconstitutional overreach of federal authority  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The case was initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael Simon, but he recused himself due to a potential conflict of interest, as his wife, a Democratic member of Congress, had publicly opposed the deployment  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. The case was then reassigned to U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut, an appointee of President Trump  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The central legal question before the court was whether the President had the authority to federalise and deploy the Oregon National Guard against the express wishes of the state's governor. The state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the deployment violated the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which reserves to the states powers not delegated to the federal government, including the primary responsibility for local law enforcement  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. They contended that the federal government's actions represented a "heavy-handed deployment of troops" that would escalate tensions and infringe upon state sovereignty  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Trump administration, for its part, argued that the President was acting within his lawful authority to protect federal property and personnel. The administration's legal justification appeared to rely on a broad interpretation of federal statutes, including the Insurrection Act, which allows the President to federalise the National Guard in cases of "rebellion" or when the President is unable to execute federal laws through regular means  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The government asserted that the protests in Portland, particularly those near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, constituted a "danger of rebellion," thereby triggering the President's authority to act  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>During a hearing on the state and city's request for a temporary restraining order, Judge Immergut expressed significant scepticism about the federal government's characterisation of the situation in Portland as a "rebellion"  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. She questioned whether the sporadic incidents of violence and property damage cited by the government met the high threshold required to invoke the extraordinary powers of the Insurrection Act  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. The judge also noted that the administration's justification seemed to be based on an outdated and exaggerated view of the protests, which had significantly dwindled in size and intensity in the weeks leading up to the deployment order  <sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, October 4, 2025, Judge Immergut granted the temporary restraining order, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. In her ruling, Immergut stated that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the deployment was unconstitutional  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. She wrote that "This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs" and that the President's actions appeared to undermine the "sovereign interest of Oregon as protected by the Tenth Amendment"  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The judge's decision to grant the temporary restraining order was a significant legal victory for the state of Oregon and a rebuke of the Trump administration's expansive claims of executive power. It affirmed the principle of judicial review over executive actions, even in the context of domestic unrest, and underscored the constitutional limitations on the President's authority to deploy military forces within the United States. The ruling did not resolve the underlying legal issues in the case, but it provided a crucial pause in the escalating confrontation and shifted the legal battleground to the courtroom, where the fundamental principles of federalism and the separation of powers would be vigorously debated.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Broader Implications and Precedents</h3>
            <p>The federal court's decision to temporarily block the deployment of the National Guard in Portland carries with it a host of broader implications that extend far beyond the specific circumstances of the 2020 protests. This case serves as a contemporary touchstone for the enduring constitutional debates surrounding federalism, executive power, and the role of the military in domestic affairs. Its outcome, even in the form of a temporary injunction, has the potential to shape the legal and political landscape for years to come, setting precedents for how future administrations may approach similar situations of civil unrest.</p>
            <p>One of the most significant implications of the Portland case is its reaffirmation of the principle of state sovereignty as enshrined in the Tenth Amendment. The court's decision to grant the temporary restraining order on the grounds that the federal deployment would likely violate Oregon's sovereign interests sends a strong message about the constitutional limits on federal power to intervene in matters of local law enforcement. It reinforces the idea that states retain primary responsibility for maintaining public order within their borders and that the federal government cannot unilaterally commandeer state resources, such as the National Guard, without a clear and compelling constitutional or statutory basis. This aspect of the ruling could embolden other states to resist what they perceive as federal overreach in the future, potentially leading to more frequent and robust legal challenges to federal interventions in state and local affairs  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The case also has important implications for the scope of presidential power, particularly in the context of domestic emergencies. The Trump administration's reliance on a broad interpretation of the Insurrection Act to justify the deployment in Portland was met with judicial scepticism, suggesting that courts may be increasingly willing to scrutinise the factual basis for a president's invocation of emergency powers  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. This judicial check on executive authority is crucial for preventing the misuse of emergency powers for political purposes and for ensuring that the extraordinary measure of deploying the military domestically is reserved for genuine crises that cannot be managed by civilian authorities. The Portland case could, therefore, contribute to a more cautious and legally constrained approach to the use of the Insurrection Act by future presidents.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the events in Portland and the subsequent legal battle have brought the role of the Department of Homeland Security in domestic policing into sharp focus. The creation of DHS in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was primarily intended to enhance the nation's ability to respond to foreign threats. However, the deployment of DHS agents in Portland for crowd control and protest policing has raised concerns about the militarisation of domestic law enforcement and the blurring of lines between counterterrorism and the management of civil dissent  <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. The controversies surrounding the actions of DHS agents in Portland are likely to fuel ongoing debates about the proper role and oversight of this powerful federal agency, with potential calls for legislative reforms to clarify its mission and authority in the domestic sphere.</p>
            <p>The Portland case also highlights the critical role of the judiciary as a bulwark against potential abuses of power by the executive branch. In a highly polarised political environment, the courts are often seen as the last resort for upholding the rule of law and protecting constitutional rights. Judge Immergut's decision, particularly given that she was an appointee of the president whose administration she was ruling against, underscores the importance of an independent judiciary that is willing to hold the executive branch accountable to the Constitution  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. This case serves as a powerful reminder of the judiciary's co-equal role in the American system of government and its responsibility to interpret and apply the law without fear or favour.</p>
            <p>Finally, the events in Portland and the legal challenges that ensued have undoubtedly left a lasting mark on the relationship between the federal government and state and local authorities. The deep divisions and mistrust that were exposed during the summer of 2020 will likely take time to heal. The Portland case may serve as a cautionary tale for future administrations, highlighting the potential for federal intervention to backfire and to create more conflict and division rather than to resolve it. It underscores the importance of cooperation and communication between different levels of government in responding to civil unrest and the dangers of a confrontational approach that disregards the concerns and the authority of state and local officials. The precedents set in this case, both legal and political, will continue to be debated and invoked as the nation grapples with the complex challenges of maintaining public order while protecting the fundamental rights and liberties of its citizens.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The temporary injunction issued by a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, represents a significant chapter in the ongoing narrative of American constitutional law. It was a moment when the judiciary was called upon to adjudicate a direct and profound conflict between the executive branch of the federal government and the sovereign authority of a state. The court's decision to temporarily halt the deployment of the National Guard was not merely a procedural ruling in a localised dispute; it was a powerful assertion of the principle of judicial review and a reaffirmation of the constitutional limits on executive power.</p>
            <p>This article has sought to provide a comprehensive and dispassionate analysis of the events that led to this legal showdown, the historical and legal framework in which it unfolded, and the broader implications of the court's intervention. From the streets of Portland, where protests for racial justice evolved into a protracted and at times violent confrontation with law enforcement, to the hallowed halls of the federal courthouse, where fundamental questions of constitutional law were debated, the story of Portland in the summer of 2020 is a story of a nation grappling with its deepest divisions and its most cherished legal principles.</p>
            <p>The case of Portland versus the Trump administration brought into sharp relief the delicate balance of power that lies at the heart of the American federal system. It forced a re-examination of the laws that govern the domestic use of military force, particularly the Insurrection Act and the Posse Comatus Act, and it raised critical questions about the evolving role of the Department of Homeland Security in domestic policing. The controversies surrounding the actions of federal agents in Portland, and the administration's attempt to deploy the National Guard against the will of the state, served as a stark reminder of the potential for federal power to be used in ways that many see as an infringement upon the rights of states and the liberties of individuals.</p>
            <p>The judicial scrutiny that the executive's actions received in this case is a testament to the enduring strength of the American system of checks and balances. The court's willingness to question the factual basis for the president's invocation of emergency powers and to uphold the sovereign interests of the state of Oregon demonstrates that even in times of great political turmoil, the rule of law can prevail.</p>
            <p>The long-term consequences of the events in Portland and the legal battles they spawned will continue to unfold. The precedents set in this case will undoubtedly be cited in future disputes over the balance of power between the federal government and the states. The debates over the proper role of the military in domestic affairs and the accountability of federal law enforcement agencies will continue to shape public policy and legal discourse.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the story of the temporary injunction in Portland is a story about the resilience of the American constitutional order. It is a story that underscores the importance of an independent judiciary, the enduring relevance of the principles of federalism and the separation of powers, and the ongoing struggle to find the proper balance between security and liberty. It is a story that, for all its conflict and controversy, offers a powerful affirmation of the idea that in the United States, the government is one of laws, and not of men.</p>
