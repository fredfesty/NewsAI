            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The astronomical community has witnessed a surge in the discovery of exoplanets, celestial bodies orbiting stars outside our solar system. A significant subset of this research is dedicated to identifying planets that reside within the habitable zone of their host star, a region where conditions might permit the existence of liquid water, a crucial ingredient for life as we understand it. This article provides a comprehensive examination of recent exoplanet discoveries that have been identified as potential candidates for harbouring liquid water. It delves into the methodologies employed for their detection and characterisation, with a particular focus on the transit method and radial velocity measurements. The article further explores the concept of the habitable zone, its evolving definition, and the various stellar and planetary factors that influence a planet's potential for habitability. Through an in-depth analysis of specific exoplanetary systems, such as TRAPPIST-1 and the planets identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, this article elucidates the current state of knowledge and the future directions of the search for worlds that might support life. The role of advanced observatories, most notably the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), in advancing our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres and the potential for biosignatures is also critically assessed. This scholarly review synthesises the latest findings to provide a nuanced perspective on the profound scientific endeavour to ascertain whether we are alone in the universe.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The perennial question of whether life exists beyond Earth has captivated human imagination for centuries. In the contemporary scientific landscape, this inquiry has transitioned from the realm of philosophical speculation to a rigorous empirical pursuit. The discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star in 1995 marked a watershed moment, fundamentally altering our perception of the cosmos and our place within it. Since then, the field of exoplanetology has experienced exponential growth, with the confirmed number of exoplanets now exceeding six thousand  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. This burgeoning catalogue of alien worlds presents a diverse array of planetary architectures, many of which bear little resemblance to those found within our own solar system  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Amongst this vast planetary census, a primary objective for astronomers is the identification of terrestrial, or rocky, planets that orbit their host stars within the habitable zone. This circumstellar region is conventionally defined as the range of orbital distances where a planet with a suitable atmosphere could maintain liquid water on its surface. The presence of liquid water is considered a fundamental prerequisite for the emergence and sustenance of life as we know it, rendering the search for such 'water worlds' a central focus of astrobiological research  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This article will provide a detailed and critical examination of recent discoveries of exoplanets that have been flagged as potentially possessing liquid water. It will begin with a historical overview of the search for exoplanets, tracing the evolution of detection techniques and the theoretical frameworks that guide the quest for habitable worlds. The core of the article will then be dedicated to a thorough analysis of several key exoplanetary systems that have garnered significant attention for their potential to harbour liquid water. This will include a discussion of the observational data that underpin these claims, as well as the theoretical models used to infer planetary characteristics.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the article will explore the complexities and uncertainties inherent in assessing the habitability of distant worlds. Factors such as stellar activity, planetary atmospheric composition, and the potential for tidal locking will be discussed in detail to provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the challenges involved. The transformative impact of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on the characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres will be a recurring theme, highlighting its capacity to provide unprecedented insights into the chemical makeup of these alien worlds  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. By synthesising the latest research findings and theoretical perspectives, this article aims to offer a scholarly and in-depth account of the ongoing scientific endeavour to discover potentially habitable planets and the profound implications of this search for our understanding of life in the universe.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The concept of worlds orbiting other suns, or exoplanets, is not a new one. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Epicurus posited the existence of an infinite number of worlds, both similar to and different from our own. However, it was not until the latter half of the 20th century that the technological means to detect such distant planets began to emerge. Early attempts to find exoplanets focused on astrometry, the precise measurement of the positions of stars. The gravitational tug of an orbiting planet would cause its host star to 'wobble' in its motion across the sky. While this method proved challenging with the technology of the time, it laid the conceptual groundwork for future discoveries.</p>
            <p>A significant breakthrough came with the refinement of the radial velocity method, also known as the Doppler spectroscopy method. This technique measures the slight changes in a star's light spectrum as it moves towards and away from an observer. This movement is caused by the gravitational influence of an orbiting planet. In 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announced the discovery of 51 Pegasi b, the first exoplanet found orbiting a sun-like star, using this very method. This discovery galvanised the astronomical community and ushered in a new era of exoplanet research.</p>
            <p>Another highly productive detection technique is the transit method. This method relies on observing the minute dimming of a star's light as an orbiting planet passes in front of it from our vantage point. The Kepler Space Telescope, launched by NASA in 2009, was a dedicated transit survey mission that revolutionised the field. During its operational lifetime, Kepler discovered thousands of exoplanets, revealing that planets are a common feature of our galaxy  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. The Kepler mission's data indicated that a significant fraction of stars host planets, and that small, potentially rocky planets are abundant  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Building on the legacy of Kepler, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), launched in 2018, is conducting an all-sky survey to find exoplanets orbiting nearby bright stars  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. The proximity of these TESS-discovered planets makes them ideal targets for follow-up observations to characterise their atmospheres and determine their potential for habitability  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets through these and other methods has provided a rich dataset for statistical analysis, allowing astronomers to estimate the prevalence of different types of planets throughout the Milky Way  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The theoretical framework for the search for habitable worlds is largely centred on the concept of the habitable zone. This concept, first proposed by Hubertus Strughold in 1953 and later popularised by astronomers like Carl Sagan, defines the orbital region around a star where a planet could possess liquid water on its surface. The boundaries of the habitable zone are determined by the amount of stellar radiation a planet receives. If a planet is too close to its star, any water would boil away, while if it is too far, the water would freeze. The habitable zone is not a static concept and its boundaries can evolve as a star ages and its luminosity changes  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. Moreover, the 'Goldilocks' analogy, suggesting a 'just right' distance, is a simplification. The actual surface temperature of a planet is heavily influenced by the composition and density of its atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. A planet with a thick, heat-trapping atmosphere could maintain liquid water at a greater distance from its star than a planet with a thin atmosphere.</p>

            <h3>Recent Discoveries of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets</h3>
            <p>The ongoing search for exoplanets has yielded a number of compelling candidates that reside within their host star's habitable zone and are considered to have the potential for liquid water. These discoveries are often the result of extensive observational campaigns and sophisticated data analysis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The TRAPPIST-1 System: A Laboratory for Habitable Worlds</h3>
            <p>One of the most significant discoveries in recent years has been the TRAPPIST-1 system, located approximately 40 light-years from Earth  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. This system consists of at least seven Earth-sized rocky planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. The compactness of this system is remarkable, with all seven planets orbiting closer to their star than Mercury does to our sun  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. Due to the low luminosity of the host star, the habitable zone is much closer in, and it is estimated that at least three of the TRAPPIST-1 planets—d, e, and f—orbit within this zone  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The TRAPPIST-1 planets are thought to be tidally locked, meaning that one side of each planet perpetually faces the star while the other side is in permanent darkness  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. This could lead to extreme temperature differences between the two hemispheres. However, a sufficiently thick atmosphere could potentially redistribute heat, creating more moderate conditions in the terminator zone, the region between the day and night sides  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. The TRAPPIST-1 system has become a prime target for atmospheric characterisation with the James Webb Space Telescope. Early observations of TRAPPIST-1 b, the innermost planet, have suggested the absence of a thick hydrogen-dominated atmosphere  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. More recently, investigations into TRAPPIST-1e have yielded hints of a possible atmosphere, though further observations are needed for confirmation  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. The study of the TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to compare the atmospheres of multiple terrestrial planets orbiting the same star, providing invaluable insights into the processes that shape planetary environments  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>TESS Discoveries: Expanding the Catalogue of Nearby Worlds</h3>
            <p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been instrumental in identifying numerous exoplanet candidates orbiting bright, nearby stars. These discoveries are particularly valuable because the brightness of the host stars facilitates follow-up spectroscopic observations to study the planets' atmospheres.</p>
            <p>One notable TESS discovery is TOI-715 b, a 'super-Earth' located 137 light-years away  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. This planet is approximately one and a half times the size of Earth and orbits within the conservative habitable zone of its red dwarf host star  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The relatively short orbital period of 19 days allows for frequent transits, making it an excellent target for atmospheric studies with the JWST  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The potential presence of a second, Earth-sized planet in the same system further enhances its scientific interest  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Another intriguing candidate is TOI-1452 b, an exoplanet located about 100 light-years from Earth  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. This planet is larger and more massive than Earth, and initial analyses of its density suggest that it could be a 'water world', a planet with a substantial fraction of its mass composed of water  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. If confirmed, TOI-1452 b could be covered by a deep, global ocean  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to play a crucial role in characterising the atmosphere of this planet and determining its true nature  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>In August 2025, astronomers confirmed the existence of a fifth planet, L 98-59 f, in a system 35 light-years away  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. This super-Earth has a minimum mass 2.8 times that of Earth and orbits its red dwarf star within the habitable zone  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. The planet receives a similar amount of stellar energy as Earth, making it a compelling target in the search for liquid water  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. The detection of this planet was achieved through the radial velocity method, as it does not transit its star from our perspective  <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Other Promising Candidates</h3>
            <p>The exoplanet K2-18 b, a super-Earth orbiting a red dwarf star 124 light-years away, has been the subject of intense study and some debate  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapour in its atmosphere, a significant finding for a planet in the habitable zone  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. More recent observations with the JWST have provided further insights, suggesting the presence of carbon-bearing molecules and raising the possibility that K2-18 b could be a 'Hycean' world—a planet with a liquid water ocean beneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. However, some studies have challenged the idea that such planets would be conducive to life  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Kepler mission also identified several promising candidates, including Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f. These two planets orbit a star 1,200 light-years away and are both located within the habitable zone  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. Kepler-62f is only 40 percent larger than Earth, making it one of the most Earth-sized exoplanets discovered in the habitable zone of another star at the time of its discovery  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The sub-Neptune exoplanet TOI-2257b, discovered in 2021, orbits its star in a way that could allow it to harbour liquid water, despite having an estimated surface temperature of around -16 degrees Celsius  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. The high pressure on this planet, which is more than five times the mass of Earth, could potentially keep water in a liquid state  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Role of the James Webb Space Telescope</h3>
            <p>The launch and successful deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have marked a new chapter in the study of exoplanets. With its unprecedented sensitivity and powerful suite of instruments, the JWST is capable of analysing the atmospheres of exoplanets in remarkable detail. By observing the starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere during a transit, the JWST can identify the chemical signatures of various gases, such as water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p>The JWST's early observations of exoplanets have already yielded groundbreaking results. Its study of the TRAPPIST-1 system is providing crucial data to assess the presence and composition of atmospheres around these Earth-sized worlds  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. The telescope's ability to detect potential biosignatures—gases that could be indicative of biological processes—is one of its most anticipated capabilities. However, the interpretation of such findings will require careful consideration of potential non-biological sources. The JWST is also being used to study the atmospheric conditions of 'water world' candidates like TOI-1452 b and K2-18 b, with the aim of confirming the presence of substantial amounts of water and characterising their environments  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. The data from the JWST will be essential for moving beyond the mere identification of potentially habitable planets to a more comprehensive understanding of their actual habitability.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Challenges and Future Directions</h3>
            <p>Despite the remarkable progress in the discovery and characterisation of exoplanets, significant challenges remain. The detection of a planet within the habitable zone is only the first step in assessing its potential for life. A multitude of other factors, including the planet's atmospheric composition, the presence of a magnetic field to shield it from harmful stellar radiation, and the stability of its climate, all play a crucial role.</p>
            <p>The activity of the host star is a particularly important consideration, especially for planets orbiting red dwarfs. These stars are known for their frequent and powerful flares, which could strip away a planet's atmosphere over time  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. Understanding the long-term impact of stellar activity on planetary habitability is an active area of research.</p>
            <p>Future advancements in observational capabilities will be crucial for addressing these challenges. The next generation of ground-based and space-based telescopes will provide even greater sensitivity and resolution, allowing for more detailed studies of exoplanet atmospheres. The development of techniques for direct imaging of exoplanets—separating their light from the overwhelming glare of their host stars—will offer a new window into these distant worlds.</p>
