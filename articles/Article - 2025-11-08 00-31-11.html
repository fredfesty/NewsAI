            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>In the waters of the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific, a dramatic and lethal shift in United States foreign policy is unfolding. Since September 2025, a sustained military campaign authorised by the Trump administration has targeted and destroyed at least 18 vessels, resulting in the deaths of more than 70 individuals. Officially, this is a new front in the war on drugs, targeting 'narco-terrorists' before they can deliver their cargo to American shores. The administration has deployed a formidable naval presence, including an aircraft carrier strike group, and claims to be in a 'non-international armed conflict' with designated cartels. However, this campaign has ignited a firestorm of controversy. Regional allies, most notably Colombia, have condemned the strikes as 'murder' and a violation of sovereignty. International bodies, including the United Nations, have labelled the actions 'extrajudicial killings' that contravene established maritime and human rights law. In Washington, the policy has triggered a constitutional clash, with a divided Senate narrowly blocking attempts to reassert congressional war powers. Investigations into the identities of the deceased suggest a more complex reality than the official narrative, revealing fishermen and low-level couriers drawn by economic desperation rather than ideology. Beneath the surface of the counter-narcotics mission, many observers see the clear outlines of a different objective: regime change in Venezuela.</p>

           <h2>The Fisherman and the Fire</h2>
           <p>For the family of Alejandro Carranza, he was a fisherman who left the shores of Colombia to find his catch in the open waters of the Caribbean.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> His daily activity was fishing, a struggle to provide for his loved ones.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> In mid-September 2025, however, his vessel was struck by the United States military.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> According to the Colombian government, Carranza's boat was adrift, its engine having failed, with a distress signal active when the attack occurred.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> He was killed in the strike, one of dozens of casualties in a new and aggressive American military campaign.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> The government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro labelled the killing a 'murder' and a violation of his country's sovereignty, demanding an explanation from Washington.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> Carranza's family insists he had no connection to the drug trade.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> The incident starkly illustrates the human cost and the diplomatic fury stoked by a radical shift in U.S. counter-narcotics policy.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> For decades, the approach to maritime drug smuggling was one of law enforcement: interdiction, boarding, seizure, and arrest, typically led by the U.S. Coast Guard.<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup> This new doctrine, however, bypasses due process in favour of lethal force.<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>An Escalating Campaign</h2>
           <p>The campaign began in earnest in early September 2025.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> On 2 September, President Donald Trump announced that on his orders, U.S. military forces had conducted a 'kinetic strike' against a vessel in the southern Caribbean.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> The attack killed all eleven people aboard.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> President Trump claimed the vessel contained 'positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists' and was transporting illegal narcotics toward the United States.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> This strike marked a sharp and public departure from previous policy.<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup> In the weeks that followed, the administration announced a steady drumbeat of similar attacks.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> The theatre of operations, initially focused on the Caribbean Sea near Venezuela, expanded in October to include the Eastern Pacific Ocean.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> By early November 2025, the U.S. had conducted at least 17 strikes on 18 vessels, including a semi-submersible.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> The death toll climbed to at least 70 people.<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth became the primary announcer of the strikes, often posting videos of boats exploding in flames on social media with warnings to 'narco-terrorists'.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> The administration has consistently claimed the targets are affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations (DTOs) and are destroyed in international waters.<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> However, it has yet to make public any concrete evidence that the targets were smuggling narcotics or posed a threat to the United States.<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> This lack of transparency has fuelled criticism from international observers and U.S. lawmakers alike.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Doctrine of Armed Conflict</h2>
           <p>To legally justify this shift from law enforcement to lethal military action, the Trump administration has constructed a novel and controversial legal framework.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> In February 2025, the administration designated several Latin American groups, including the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> Following the first strike in September, President Trump formally notified Congress that the United States was in a 'non-international armed conflict' with these drug cartels, labelling their members 'unlawful combatants'.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup> This re-framing is critical, as in an armed conflict, a country can lawfully kill enemy fighters even when they pose no immediate threat.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> The legal basis for this assertion is reportedly detailed in a secret, 40-page memo produced by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).<sup><a href="#ref-47">47</a>,<a href="#ref-51">51</a></sup> The existence of this memo has been confirmed, but its contents remain classified, shielding the administration's reasoning from full public and congressional scrutiny.<sup><a href="#ref-40">40</a>,<a href="#ref-50">50</a></sup> Senators who have reviewed the document have criticised its reasoning, with Senator Tim Kaine describing it as having 'logical fallacies'.<sup><a href="#ref-47">47</a></sup> Legal experts and human rights organisations have sharply contested the administration's position.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, called for the U.S. to halt the attacks, stating they could amount to extrajudicial killings.<sup><a href="#ref-45">45</a></sup> UN experts have argued that international law does not permit the unilateral use of force abroad to fight drug trafficking, which remains a law enforcement issue.<sup><a href="#ref-48">48</a></sup> Under international human rights law, lethal force is permissible only as a last resort against an imminent threat to life.<sup><a href="#ref-45">45</a></sup> Critics argue that shipping drugs, while illegal and harmful, does not constitute an 'armed attack' that would trigger the right to self-defence under the UN Charter.<sup><a href="#ref-41">41</a></sup> The administration's argument that a speedboat hundreds of miles from U.S. shores poses an imminent threat is seen by many legal scholars as untenable.<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Divided Capitol</h2>
           <p>The campaign has provoked a constitutional confrontation in Washington over the power to wage war.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup> Alarmed by the escalating strikes and the potential for a wider conflict with Venezuela, a bipartisan coalition of senators led by Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Rand Paul has sought to curb the president's authority.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> They have forced multiple votes on a War Powers Resolution, a 1973 law designed to reassert Congress's role in authorising military action.<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup> A resolution aimed at stopping strikes against boats in international waters failed by a narrow 48-51 vote in October 2025.<sup><a href="#ref-51">51</a></sup> A subsequent, more narrowly tailored resolution that would have required congressional approval for strikes specifically against Venezuela was also defeated on 6 November 2025, by a 49-51 margin.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> Only two Republican senators, Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, crossed party lines to support the measure.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> Supporters of the resolutions argue that the executive branch does not have the authority to kill people at will on the high seas and that the military buildup signals an intent to start an unauthorised war.<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-43">43</a></sup> They contend that if the administration believes war is necessary, it must seek an Authorization for the Use of Military Force from Congress.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> Conversely, many Republicans have defended the president's actions.<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup> Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that President Trump has taken 'decisive action to protect thousands of Americans from lethal narcotics'.<sup><a href="#ref-49">49</a></sup> Senator Lindsey Graham argued that Congress should not interfere with the commander-in-chief's ability to target 'narco-terrorist organizations' that pose a threat to the country.<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The View from Bogotá and Beyond</h2>
           <p>The lethal strikes have severely strained relations with key regional partners, most notably Colombia, a cornerstone of U.S. security policy in South America for decades.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> The two nations have a long history of counter-narcotics cooperation, codified in initiatives like Plan Colombia.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup> This partnership, however, has been upended by the new U.S. policy.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been one of the most outspoken critics, calling the strikes 'murder' and urging the U.S. to respect international law.<sup><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> Following the killing of Colombian fisherman Alejandro Carranza, Petro accused the U.S. of violating Colombian sovereignty.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> In response to the criticism, President Trump labelled Petro an 'illegal drug leader' and threatened to cut U.S. assistance to the country.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> The condemnation extends beyond Colombia.<sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup> Leaders from Caribbean nations, such as Barbados's Prime Minister Mia Mottley, have voiced alarm, calling for the region to remain a 'zone of peace' and rejecting the notion of extrajudicial killings.<sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup> Even as regional governments express outrage, the U.S. has continued to build up its military forces.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup> The deployment includes at least six Navy ships, F-35 stealth jets repositioned to Puerto Rico, and, most significantly, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group.<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> This constitutes the largest U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean in decades, a force far exceeding what would be necessary to target small speedboats.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-43">43</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Faces of the Dead</h2>
           <p>While Washington frames the conflict in terms of 'narco-terrorists', investigations on the ground in Venezuela paint a more nuanced picture of the individuals being killed.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> An investigation by the Associated Press identified several of the men slain in the strikes, tracing their origins to impoverished villages on Venezuela's Paria Peninsula.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> According to relatives and local residents, the men were indeed involved in running drugs, but they were not cartel leaders or ideologically driven terrorists.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup> They were labourers, a down-on-his-luck bus driver, and fishermen who were crewing the boats for the first or second time, lured by payments of at least $500 per trip in a country gripped by economic collapse.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> One of the men killed in the first strike on 2 September was a well-known local crime boss who smuggled both drugs and people, but relatives disputed the U.S. claim that he was a member of the Tren de Aragua gang.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> The Venezuelan government has also denied that those killed in the initial strike were gang members.<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> This ground-level reality contrasts sharply with the administration's rhetoric, suggesting that the targets of this high-tech military campaign are often the most desperate and expendable players in the narcotics trade.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> The families of the deceased are often left without answers, receiving no official information about the fate of their loved ones from either the U.S. or Venezuelan governments.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Venezuelan Endgame</h2>
           <p>The sheer scale of the military deployment, combined with the administration's rhetoric, has led many analysts and lawmakers to conclude that the counter-narcotics campaign is a prelude to, or a cover for, a larger strategic objective: regime change in Venezuela.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The Trump administration has long pursued the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. indicted on drug charges during Trump's first term and for whose arrest it has offered a $50 million reward.<sup><a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been a driving force behind a hard-line policy toward Venezuela.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> The administration has reportedly developed a range of options for military action inside Venezuela and has considered striking land-based targets such as ports and airstrips allegedly used for trafficking.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> Further escalating matters, President Trump confirmed in October 2025 that he had authorised the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct 'covert action' in Venezuela.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup> This could encompass a range of activities, from propaganda to paramilitary raids aimed at destabilising the Maduro government.<sup><a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup> While the administration has claimed its focus is on drugs, the intense focus on Venezuela is telling, as security experts note that only a small portion of cocaine and almost none of the fentanyl entering the U.S. transits through the country.<sup><a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup> The campaign's true goal, many believe, is to apply sufficient military and political pressure to force Maduro and his allies from power.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The campaign of lethal strikes in the waters off South America represents a profound departure in American foreign and military policy. It has replaced a decades-long, law-enforcement-led consensus on counter-narcotics with unilateral military action, justified by a contested legal theory of armed conflict against designated terrorist groups. This new doctrine has created significant friction with regional allies, drawn condemnation from international legal bodies, and sparked a constitutional debate within the United States over presidential war powers. While the stated goal is to protect American lives by stopping the flow of drugs, the evidence suggests the campaign's impact on the vast narcotics trade is minimal, instead killing low-level operatives and civilians caught in the crossfire. The massive military buildup and the authorisation of covert action point toward a broader, more ambitious and potentially destabilising objective focused on Venezuela. The long-term consequences of this policy remain uncertain. What is clear is that in the name of fighting 'narco-terrorists', Washington has embarked on a course that challenges established international norms, alienates partners, and risks embroiling the United States in a wider, more unpredictable conflict.</p>
