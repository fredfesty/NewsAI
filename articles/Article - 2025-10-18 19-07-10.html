            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A high-stakes meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded with a definitive shift in Washington’s approach to the conflict, moving away from supplying long-range offensive weaponry and towards an immediate, frozen peace. President Trump’s refusal to commit to providing Tomahawk cruise missiles, coupled with his public call for both Kyiv and Moscow to 'declare victory' at the current battle lines, followed a crucial phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has fundamentally altered the diplomatic landscape of the three-and-a-half-year war.</p>

           <h2>The White House Summit and the Policy Pivot</h2>
           <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Washington on Friday, 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, for a meeting with US President Donald Trump, a visit hastily arranged amid growing speculation over a potential new tranche of American military aid<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The central focus of the talks was Kyiv’s urgent request for the long-range Tomahawk cruise missile system<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. However, the outcome of the White House summit signalled a dramatic and immediate pivot in American policy, shifting the emphasis from military support designed to alter the battlefield status quo to an immediate, brokered peace<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.<br><br>Following the meeting, President Trump publicly cooled on the prospect of supplying the Tomahawk missiles<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. He told journalists that he hoped to secure peace with Russia first, stating, “Hopefully they won’t need it”<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The American President also expressed a reluctance to deplete the United States’ own arsenal, noting, “We want Tomahawks, also. We don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Ukrainian leader, who wore a dark suit for his third meeting with Mr Trump since the US President’s return to power<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>, left the White House without the commitment he had sought for the powerful long-range weapons<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.<br><br>The most significant policy shift came in President Trump’s subsequent public statements, which urged an immediate cessation of hostilities<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. He implored both Ukraine and Russia to “stop the war immediately”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. In a post on his Truth Social platform, the President elaborated on his proposal, stating that the combatants should “stop where they are” and “Let both claim Victory, let History decide!”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This proposal effectively called for a freezing of the conflict along the current battle lines, which would necessitate Ukraine conceding territory currently under Russian occupation<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Russia currently controls approximately 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory, including the eastern Donbas region<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Mr Trump’s call for a deal was framed by the sentiment that “Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Long-Range Missile Dilemma</h2>
           <p>The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a long-range, subsonic cruise missile, first introduced in the 1980s<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Manufactured by American firm Raytheon<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, the missile is propelled by a jet engine and guided by a suite of navigation aids, including GPS<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Its operational range is a critical factor, stretching to approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) for some variants<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. This range is vastly superior to Ukraine’s existing deep-strike capabilities, such as the US-supplied Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which has a range of only about 186 to 300 miles (300 kilometres)<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The Tomahawk’s design allows it to fly at low altitudes, making it difficult for Russian radar systems, including the S-400, to detect and intercept<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.<br><br>Kyiv’s strategic rationale for acquiring the Tomahawks was to gain the ability to strike high-value Russian targets deep within its territory, far from the front lines<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Potential targets included drone factories, oil depots, command centres, and critical logistics hubs<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha suggested that such a display of strength could “truly create momentum for peace” by increasing the costs of the war for Moscow<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The missile, which carries a 1,000lb (approximately 450kg) warhead<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, would be launched from land using the Typhon launcher system, a container-based platform developed after the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.<br><br>During the White House meeting, Mr Zelenskyy was frank about his country’s needs, stating, “We have drones. We don’t have Tomahawks. That’s why we need them”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. He even proposed a deal to exchange “thousands” of Ukrainian-made drones for the US missiles<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. President Trump expressed interest in the Ukrainian drones, acknowledging that Ukraine “makes a very good drone”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. However, the American President ultimately deferred the decision, choosing instead to use the prospect of the missiles as leverage in his renewed diplomatic push<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Kremlin's Diplomatic Intervention</h2>
           <p>The shift in President Trump’s position on the Tomahawk missiles was immediately preceded by a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The conversation took place on Thursday, 16 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, while President Zelenskyy was already en route to the United States<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The call was reportedly initiated by the Russian leader<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed that President Putin used the conversation to warn his American counterpart against supplying the Tomahawks<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Mr Ushakov stated that the Russian President conveyed that such a move would “cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries” and would not, in any case, “change the situation on the battlefield”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.<br><br>This interaction marked the eighth known call between the two leaders since President Trump began his second term in January<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The timing and content of the call followed a pattern where contact with the Russian President appeared to influence Mr Trump’s stance on the war<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Prior to the call, Mr Trump had appeared open to the idea of providing the missiles, even suggesting he might tell Mr Putin, “if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send the Tomahawks”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The threat of the long-range weapons had seemingly spurred the Kremlin into diplomatic action, leading to the phone call after weeks of Moscow describing the potential sale as a provocation<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.<br><br>Following the conversation, President Trump described the call as “productive”<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> and announced that he and President Putin would meet soon in Budapest, Hungary<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The meeting is expected to take place “within two weeks”<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The choice of Budapest was attributed to the mutual affinity between the two leaders and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Mr Trump indicated that the summit would likely be a “bilateral” meeting, not a trilateral one including Mr Zelenskyy, citing the “tremendous bad blood” between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The announcement of a new summit, a diplomatic win for the Russian President, was seen by critics as a tactic by Moscow to delay a resolution and buy time for its ongoing military operations<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Ceasefire on the Battle Line</h2>
           <p>The American President’s proposal for both sides to “stop where they are” and “claim Victory” represents a significant departure from the long-standing Western policy of supporting Ukraine’s full territorial integrity<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The suggestion implies a de facto recognition of Russia’s current territorial gains, which include the four regions Moscow annexed in 2022<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The proposal was framed as a humanitarian imperative to “stop the killing” and end the “vast and unsustainable sums of money spent” on the conflict<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Mr Trump also claimed that the war “would have never started” if he had been President<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.<br><br>When questioned about the proposal, President Zelenskyy offered a cautious but notable response. He told reporters that he had not seen the social media post but conceded, “The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak”<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. This statement was interpreted as a willingness to accept a temporary ceasefire along the current front lines as a necessary precursor to substantive peace negotiations<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. However, the Ukrainian President also stressed the necessity of strong security guarantees from the United States, expressing fear that without them, a ceasefire would merely allow President Putin to “come again with aggression”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.<br><br>Analysts noted that the proposal, which emerged shortly after Mr Trump’s successful brokering of a peace deal in the Gaza conflict<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, leverages the momentum of that diplomatic achievement<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The American President’s focus is now squarely on achieving a diplomatic breakthrough in Ukraine, which he has touted as his top foreign policy goal<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The core challenge remains that while Moscow has repeatedly claimed readiness for peace negotiations, its stated position—demanding Ukraine’s withdrawal from annexed regions and an end to its NATO aspirations—remains unacceptable to Kyiv and its Western allies<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Kyiv's Concession and European Disquiet</h2>
           <p>The outcome of the Washington meeting sent ripples of concern across European capitals, where leaders had been hoping for a firm commitment of advanced weaponry to bolster Ukraine’s position<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Following the talks, President Zelenskyy held a conference call with several European leaders, including British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz reportedly suggested that the meeting had not gone as the Ukrainian President had hoped<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.<br><br>European leaders reaffirmed their support for Kyiv and agreed to continue working on a peace plan, as well as options to increase pressure on Moscow through sanctions and the use of frozen Russian state assets<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Prime Minister Starmer suggested coordinating with the US to shape a Ukraine peace plan, drawing inspiration from the recent Gaza proposal<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. NATO Secretary General Rutte pushed for European security advisers to hold a rapid follow-up meeting over the weekend to coordinate their positions<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.<br><br>For Kyiv, the deferral of the Tomahawk decision and the push for an immediate ceasefire at the current battle line presents a profound dilemma. While Mr Zelenskyy expressed a willingness to stop the fighting as a first step, the lack of a security guarantee and the prospect of a bilateral Trump-Putin summit in Budapest without Ukrainian representation creates a difficult diplomatic environment<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Ukrainian analysts expressed concern over President Trump’s apparent softened stance towards Russia and the lack of concrete military aid<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Ukrainian President, however, maintained a degree of optimism, noting that it was positive that Mr Trump “didn’t say ‘no,’ but for today, (he) didn’t say ‘yes’” to providing the Tomahawks<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The White House meeting on 17 October 2025 marked a definitive turning point in the international management of the Russia-Ukraine war, shifting the primary American objective from arming Kyiv for victory to brokering an immediate cessation of hostilities<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. President Trump’s decision to withhold the Tomahawk missiles, a weapon capable of fundamentally altering the strategic balance by striking deep into Russian territory<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, was a direct consequence of his preceding conversation with President Putin<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The subsequent call for both nations to ‘declare victory’ at the current battle lines, while framed as a humanitarian measure to end the bloodshed<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, effectively endorses a freezing of the conflict that would leave Russia in control of a significant portion of Ukrainian land<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. This new American calculus places the onus on Kyiv to accept a negotiated settlement based on the current military reality, rather than continuing a war of attrition with the hope of reclaiming all lost territory<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The upcoming bilateral summit between the American and Russian Presidents in Budapest<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> now stands as the central diplomatic forum, sidelining Kyiv and forcing European allies to rapidly coordinate their own peace initiatives to ensure their interests are not overlooked in the pursuit of a swift, American-led deal<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p>
