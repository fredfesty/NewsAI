            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The 'one in, one out' migration pilot, a flagship policy agreed between the UK and France in July 2025, is facing intense scrutiny following the confirmed return of two migrants who had previously been deported under the scheme. Designed to deter dangerous small boat crossings by creating a reciprocal returns mechanism, the policy allows the UK to send irregular arrivals back to France in exchange for accepting an equal number of vetted asylum seekers with family links to Britain. Despite the government's insistence that the immediate detention of the returnees proves the system is working, the policy's limited scale—with fewer than 100 people returned against a backdrop of nearly 39,000 Channel arrivals in 2025—has led critics to dismiss it as an ineffective deterrent. The personal testimony of one returnee, who claimed to have fled modern slavery in France, highlights the complex humanitarian and legal challenges that undermine the policy's core objective.</p>

           <h2>The New Architecture of Deterrence</h2>
           <p>The 'one in, one out' pilot scheme, formally agreed between the United Kingdom and France in July 2025, was presented as a groundbreaking diplomatic solution to the persistent crisis of small boat crossings in the English Channel<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The agreement, a central pillar of the UK government’s strategy to manage irregular migration, established a reciprocal mechanism for the first time since the UK’s departure from the European Union<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Under the terms of the treaty, the UK gained the legal basis to detain and return irregular migrants who arrived by small boat to France, which the UK considers a safe third country<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. In exchange for each person returned, the UK committed to accepting one asylum seeker from France through a new, controlled legal route<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This legal pathway is strictly limited to individuals who have not previously attempted an illegal crossing and can demonstrate a genuine family link to the UK<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The stated objective of the policy was to break the business model of people-smuggling gangs by demonstrating that the perilous journey across the Channel would ultimately be in vain<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The pilot was initially expected to operate on a small scale, with reports suggesting a target of up to 50 returns per week, a number that represents a minor fraction of the total annual arrivals<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The treaty was ratified and came into force in August 2025, with the first removals taking place in September<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Flood Against a Trickle</h2>
           <p>The operational reality of the scheme has been immediately overshadowed by the sheer volume of people continuing to make the Channel crossing<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. By September 7, 2025, the total number of small boat arrivals for the year had already surpassed 30,000, reaching that milestone earlier than in any previous year since data collection began in 2018<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. By November 9, 2025, the cumulative total of arrivals for the year stood at 38,726, exceeding the 36,816 recorded for the entirety of 2024<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. This surge in crossings has continued even as the returns policy was implemented<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. In a three-day period between November 6 and 8, 2025, more than 1,700 people successfully made the journey, highlighting the persistent operational challenge<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Against this backdrop, the number of migrants returned to France under the 'one in, one out' pilot has remained small<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. As of late October and early November 2025, the UK had removed between 75 and 94 irregular migrants to France<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. In the reciprocal part of the deal, the UK had accepted between 51 and 57 approved asylum seekers from France through the new legal route<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Critics have seized on this disparity, arguing that the policy is failing to act as a meaningful deterrent<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The Conservative opposition leader, Kemi Badenoch, and other critics have characterised the scheme as a 'total abject failure,' noting that thousands of people have crossed since the deal was announced<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The government, however, has maintained that the policy is a long-term strategy that will be scaled up, with the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, stating that the returns send a clear warning to those considering an illegal entry<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Circular Journey of the Returnees</h2>
           <p>The most significant challenge to the policy’s credibility emerged not from the overall numbers, but from the individual cases of those who were returned<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The first confirmed instance of a migrant returning to the UK after being deported under the scheme involved an Iranian man<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. He had initially arrived in the UK on August 6, 2025, and was subsequently returned to France on September 19, becoming one of the first individuals removed under the new treaty<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Less than a month later, on October 18, he successfully made the Channel crossing again in a small boat and was detained upon arrival<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The man claimed that he had been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of people smugglers in northern France, stating that he did not feel safe in France and was afraid for his life<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. He alleged that smugglers had forced him to work, abused him, and threatened him with weapons<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Following his second arrival, the UK government expedited his case, and he was deported to France for a second time in early November 2025<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Home Office defended the process, arguing that the immediate detection and re-removal proved the system was functioning as intended<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. A second migrant who had been removed to France under the pilot scheme also returned to the UK on a small boat on November 10, 2025<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This individual was also identified using biometrics and detained immediately, with officials confirming that his removal would be expedited<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The French Interior Ministry has countered claims of unsafe conditions, asserting that returnees are accommodated while their cases are assessed<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Nevertheless, the repeated return of deported individuals has provided powerful ammunition for critics who argue that the policy is not a deterrent but merely a revolving door<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Deterrent Effect and Legal Limbo</h2>
           <p>The fundamental premise of the 'one in, one out' policy rests on the concept of deterrence, aiming to discourage irregular crossings by removing the perceived benefit of reaching British soil<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. However, the effectiveness of deterrence in migration policy is a subject of considerable debate among experts<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Critics argue that policies which close off legal avenues for asylum seekers often force people into more dangerous and irregular routes, thereby empowering the very smuggling networks the policy aims to dismantle<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The limited scope of the legal route offered by the scheme further complicates its deterrent potential<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Only those with close family ties in the UK and who have not previously attempted an illegal crossing are eligible, excluding the vast majority of people making the journey<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Furthermore, individuals returned to France face a complex legal situation<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. While France is considered a safe third country, the returnees are placed back into the French asylum system, which may not be their desired destination or one where they feel secure, as evidenced by the testimony of the Iranian man<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) welcomed the announcement of the pilot, provided that its implementation upheld access to asylum, ensuring that those transferred back to France would have the possibility to claim asylum there<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. However, the practical and humanitarian concerns raised by the returnees’ actions suggest that for some, the perceived risks of a second Channel crossing are outweighed by the conditions or dangers they face in northern France<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The political pressure on the UK government remains intense, with the rising number of arrivals and the high-profile returns placing the policy under continuous scrutiny<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The 'one in, one out' pilot scheme represents a significant diplomatic achievement for the UK government, establishing a post-Brexit returns mechanism with a major European partner<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Yet, its initial months of operation have exposed a profound gap between political ambition and operational reality<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The policy’s limited scale, with fewer than 100 returns against tens of thousands of arrivals, has failed to stem the flow of small boats, which continues to set new records<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The return of deported individuals, particularly the Iranian man who cited fear of modern slavery in France, has transformed the policy from a matter of statistics into a narrative of human desperation and the limits of deterrence<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. While the government maintains that the immediate re-detention of returnees validates the system’s integrity, the fact that people are willing to risk their lives and money for a second crossing suggests that the policy has not achieved its primary goal of breaking the smugglers’ business model<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The long-term success of the scheme will depend not only on its ability to scale up returns, but also on whether the French asylum system is perceived as a genuinely safe and viable alternative by those seeking refuge, a perception that the recent events have severely undermined<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
