            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the diplomatic frictions between the United States and Colombia, particularly in light of Colombian President Gustavo Petro's vocal positions on international issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While recent reports have speculated on potential escalations, including visa revocations for foreign leaders, this piece draws on verified historical and contemporary data to explore the broader context. It examines Petro's progressive foreign policy agenda, the evolution of US-Colombia relations since the early 2000s, and the mechanisms of US visa policies towards diplomatic figures. By grounding the discussion in factual developments up to 2024, the article elucidates how ideological divergences, particularly on Middle East affairs, have strained bilateral ties without descending into outright confrontations like visa cancellations. The analysis underscores the importance of multilateral diplomacy in mitigating such tensions, offering insights for scholars and policymakers alike. <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The relationship between the United States and Colombia has long been characterised by a complex interplay of security cooperation, economic interdependence, and ideological divergences. Since the election of Gustavo Petro as President of Colombia in June 2022, marking the first left-wing leader in the country's modern history, bilateral dynamics have undergone noticeable shifts. Petro's administration has prioritised environmental sustainability, social equity, and a reorientation of foreign policy towards greater autonomy from traditional US influence. This has manifested in outspoken critiques of US-backed policies, particularly in the realm of international conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.</p>

            <p>Reports emerging in late 2024 and early 2025 have highlighted potential flashpoints, including Petro's participation in global forums where he has advocated for Palestinian rights and criticised actions perceived as aligned with US interests. While no verified incident of visa revocation for Petro himself has occurred as of the latest available data in October 2024, the spectre of such measures underscores deeper tensions. This article delves into the historical backdrop, key policy positions, and legal frameworks governing US visa decisions for foreign dignitaries. It aims to clarify the mechanisms at play, ensuring a nuanced understanding devoid of sensationalism.</p>

            <p>To achieve this, the discussion is structured around the evolution of Colombia's foreign policy under Petro, the US response to Latin American leaders' stances on global issues, and the procedural aspects of visa policies. All assertions are supported by references to primary sources, including official statements, diplomatic records, and scholarly analyses, to maintain academic rigour. <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The foundations of contemporary US-Colombia relations trace back to the post-Cold War era, when Colombia became a focal point for US anti-narcotics and counter-insurgency efforts. The 2000 launch of Plan Colombia, a multibillion-dollar initiative, exemplified this partnership. Funded primarily by the US, the plan aimed to combat the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group and disrupt cocaine production. By 2016, the peace accord ending over five decades of civil conflict was signed, with significant US involvement in monitoring and support. This era solidified Colombia as a key ally in the Western Hemisphere, with annual US aid exceeding $500 million by the mid-2010s. <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup></p>

            <p>The transition to Petro's presidency introduced a paradigm shift. Elected on a platform of "total peace" and ecological transition, Petro sought to diversify Colombia's international alignments. His government has engaged more actively with regional blocs like the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and pursued ties with non-traditional partners such as China and Russia. This reorientation has not severed US ties—bilateral trade reached $35 billion in 2023—but has introduced frictions, particularly over human rights and environmental policies. <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup></p>

            <p>A pivotal aspect of Petro's foreign policy has been his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Colombia has historically maintained close relations with Israel, including military cooperation dating to the 1980s. However, under Petro, this dynamic changed dramatically. In May 2024, following escalating violence in Gaza after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, Petro announced the severance of diplomatic ties with Israel. He accused the Israeli government of "genocidal" actions in Gaza, citing over 35,000 Palestinian deaths reported by health authorities as of mid-2024. This decision aligned Colombia with other Latin American nations like Bolivia, Belize, and Honduras, which had also recalled ambassadors or cut ties. Petro's rhetoric, including calls for international accountability, echoed broader Global South sentiments. <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>

            <p>This position drew immediate US criticism. The Biden administration, a staunch supporter of Israel, expressed concern over the move, with State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller stating in May 2024 that it undermined regional stability. Petro, in response, defended his decision at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2023 and subsequent forums, framing it as a moral imperative. Such exchanges highlight how domestic politics in both nations influence bilateral relations. In the US, unwavering support for Israel is bipartisan, enshrined in annual aid packages of $3.8 billion since 2016. In Colombia, Petro's base, comprising indigenous, Afro-Colombian, and urban progressive communities, views the policy as a break from past subservience. <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup></p>

        <section>
            <h2>US Visa Policies Towards Foreign Leaders</h2>
            <p>US visa policies are governed by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, and administered by the Department of State. For diplomatic and official visas (A-1 and A-2 categories), eligibility hinges on reciprocity, national security, and foreign policy considerations. Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Act allows denial if the applicant's activities could have "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences." While routine for tourists and business travellers, visas for heads of state are typically granted as a matter of protocol, often via diplomatic channels without formal application.</p>

            <p>Historical precedents illustrate the rare but pointed use of visa revocations against leaders. In 2019, the Trump administration revoked visas for International Criminal Court officials investigating US actions in Afghanistan, citing interference. Similarly, in 2021, the Biden administration imposed travel bans on certain Chinese officials over Xinjiang human rights abuses. For Latin American leaders, instances are fewer; Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's US visa was revoked in 2019 amid sanctions, but this was tied to broader isolation efforts rather than a single statement. No such action has been taken against a sitting Colombian president in modern history. <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup></p>

            <p>In the context of pro-Palestinian advocacy, the US has occasionally restricted entry for activists or officials perceived as supporting terrorism, per the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. However, for elected leaders like Petro, revocations would risk diplomatic fallout, potentially violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961), which mandates respect for accredited representatives. Petro's visits to the US, including a 2023 White House meeting with President Biden, proceeded without incident, focusing on migration and drug policy. Speculation about future tensions, especially with a potential return of Donald Trump to the presidency in January 2025 following the November 2024 election, stems from Trump's past "America First" approach, which included visa curbs on critics. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump revoked visas for over 1,000 individuals linked to the Muslim travel ban, though not specifically for Latin American heads of state. <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup></p>

            <p>Petro's interactions with US political figures have been mixed. In 2023, he met with Democratic lawmakers in Washington, advocating for debt relief and climate finance. However, his criticisms of US interventionism, including references to historical support for right-wing regimes in Latin America, have irked conservative circles. At a September 2023 New York event during the UN General Assembly, Petro spoke on Palestinian rights, drawing parallels to Colombian indigenous struggles—a theme he reiterated in subsequent addresses. While no rally involved direct calls for US military disobedience, his rhetoric has been interpreted by some as provocative. <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Gustavo Petro's Pro-Palestinian Advocacy</h2>
            <p>Petro's engagement with the Palestinian cause predates his presidency. As a former guerrilla member of the M-19 movement and senator, he consistently criticised Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Upon taking office, he appointed foreign ministers aligned with this view, such as Álvaro Leyva, who in 2023 upgraded Palestinian representation in Bogotá to embassy status. This symbolic gesture preceded the 2024 tie severance.</p>

            <p>The escalation followed Israel's military response to the October 7, 2023, attacks, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostages. By October 2024, Gaza's death toll exceeded 42,000, per the Hamas-run health ministry, prompting global protests. Petro joined leaders like Brazil's Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in condemning the response at the BRICS summit in August 2024, where expanded membership included Egypt and Iran, signalling a multipolar shift. In Colombia, domestic protests in 2024 saw thousands marching in solidarity with Palestine, bolstered by Petro's administration halting arms purchases from Israel in October 2023. <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup></p>

            <p>Critics, including former President Iván Duque, accused Petro of antisemitism, a charge he refuted by distinguishing anti-Zionism from prejudice. US-based Jewish organisations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, monitored his statements, but no formal visa actions ensued. Instead, economic levers were employed; in 2024, the US paused some military aid to Colombia over labour rights concerns in extractive industries, indirectly linked to Petro's reforms. <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Prospects for Escalation in US-Colombia Relations</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, the 2024 US presidential election looms large. If Donald Trump wins, as polls suggested a tight race into November 2024, his administration's foreign policy could amplify tensions. Trump's 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the Abraham Accords prioritised pro-Israel stances, potentially viewing Petro's positions as adversarial. During the 2024 campaign, Trump criticised Latin American "socialist" governments, including Colombia's, for migration flows—over 300,000 Colombians sought US asylum in 2023. <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup></p>

            <p>Conversely, a Kamala Harris victory would likely maintain Biden's pragmatic engagement, as evidenced by the 2023 US-Colombia action plan on narcotics. Multilateral forums like the Organization of American States (OAS) provide buffers; in 2024, OAS resolutions on Gaza garnered Latin American support, diluting bilateral strains. Economically, Colombia's reliance on US markets—exports like coffee and oil constitute 30% of total—deters drastic measures. Visa revocation for a president would be unprecedented and counterproductive, likely prompting reciprocal actions and legal challenges under international law. <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup></p>

            <p>Scholars argue that such frictions reflect broader deglobalisation trends. A 2024 Council on Foreign Relations report noted increasing autonomy among middle powers like Colombia, challenging US hegemony. Petro's "hippies in government" vision emphasises ethical diplomacy, potentially inspiring regional peers. Yet, internal challenges—Colombia's 2024 homicide rate of 25 per 100,000 and economic growth of 1.1%—constrain bold foreign moves. <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Role of International Law and Diplomacy</h2>
            <p>International law provides guardrails for visa disputes. The UN Charter's Article 2(4) prohibits threats to sovereignty, while the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) protects freedom of expression, relevant to Petro's public statements. Diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention extends to transit, but visas remain a sovereign prerogative. In practice, the US has balanced enforcement with pragmatism; a 2023 State Department cable, leaked via WikiLeaks archives, outlined "calibrated responses" to allied dissent. <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup></p>

            <p>Case studies from other regions illuminate possibilities. In 2018, the US denied a visa to International Court of Justice judge Ebrahim Karim, an Iranian, over sanctions. Closer to home, Bolivian President Evo Morales faced travel restrictions in 2019 amid political crisis, though not formally revoked. For Petro, any hypothetical revocation would invoke Article 41 of the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on State Responsibility, allowing countermeasures but requiring proportionality. <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup></p>

            <p>Diplomatic channels mitigate risks. The US Embassy in Bogotá and Colombian Mission to the UN facilitate dialogue. In 2024, Vice President Francia Márquez's US visits addressed shared concerns like deforestation, fostering goodwill. Public diplomacy, including Petro's English-language op-eds in outlets like The New York Times, aims to shape narratives. <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The interplay of Gustavo Petro's pro-Palestinian advocacy and US visa policies exemplifies the delicate balance in US-Colombia relations. While no revocation has materialised, underlying tensions stem from ideological divergences amplified by global events. Historical cooperation endures, but future trajectories depend on US electoral outcomes and multilateral engagement. This analysis reveals the need for dialogue to preserve mutual interests, ensuring that rhetorical clashes do not erode substantive partnerships. By examining these dynamics through a lens of verified facts, the article contributes to scholarly discourse on hemispheric diplomacy in an era of shifting alliances.</p>

            <p><b>Number Of Factual Errors:</b> 3</p>
            <p><b>1. The article repeatedly asserts that no visa revocation for President Petro has occurred (e.g., in Introduction, US Visa Policies section, and Conclusion), based on data up to October 2024; however, on September 28, 2025, the US State Department revoked his visa after he urged US soldiers to disobey orders at a New York pro-Palestine rally, as reported by major outlets like The New York Times and CNN.</b></p>
            <p><b>2. The article speculates on potential US visa actions tied to a "potential return of Donald Trump" post-2024 election without escalation, but Trump won the November 2024 election and assumed office in January 2025, directly leading to the visa revocation under his administration, contradicting the article's portrayal of avoided confrontations.</b></p>
            <p><b>3. The Gaza death toll is cited as exceeding 42,000 by October 2024 per the Hamas-run health ministry; verified UN and WHO data as of September 2025 report over 45,000 deaths, but the article's figure is slightly understated and sourced inaccurately (OCHA updates confirm higher tolls earlier in 2025).</b></p>
