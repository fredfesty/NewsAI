            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A new police inquiry into allegations that Prince Andrew attempted to use a state-funded protection officer to conduct a smear campaign against his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, has intensified the crisis surrounding the former Duke of York. The investigation by the Metropolitan Police follows the recent relinquishing of his remaining royal titles and honours, a move precipitated by the emergence of correspondence that contradicted his public account of severing ties with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The latest scrutiny focuses on the alleged misuse of public resources in an effort to discredit a woman who maintained she was trafficked to the prince when she was a minor.</p>

           <h2>A New Police Inquiry into Alleged Misconduct</h2>
           <p>The Metropolitan Police Service in London has confirmed it is actively examining claims that Prince Andrew sought to enlist a taxpayer-funded close protection officer in an effort to gather damaging information on Virginia Giuffre<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. This development, announced on 19 October 2025, plunges the former Duke of York into a fresh crisis, just days after he agreed to relinquish his remaining royal titles<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The allegations centre on an email Prince Andrew reportedly sent in 2011 to Queen Elizabeth II’s then-deputy press secretary, Ed Perkins<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. In the correspondence, the prince allegedly stated that he had asked one of his personal protection officers to investigate Ms Giuffre<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The email reportedly contained Ms Giuffre’s date of birth and her confidential nine-digit United States social security number<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Prince Andrew is alleged to have claimed in the message that Ms Giuffre had a criminal record in the US<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The request for this investigation was reportedly made hours before a now-infamous photograph of the prince with Ms Giuffre was published in the media<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre’s family has publicly stated that she did not, in fact, have a criminal record<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The Metropolitan Police’s statement confirmed that the force was “aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The core of the police inquiry is the alleged misuse of a state-funded police officer for a private, potentially defamatory, purpose<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. A government minister, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, characterised the allegations as “deeply concerning” during a broadcast interview, stressing that the use of close protection officers in such a manner would be entirely inappropriate<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. There is no current suggestion that the police officer complied with the prince’s request to obtain the information<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. However, the mere act of making the request and providing confidential personal data to a police officer for this purpose raises serious questions about the prince’s conduct and the potential breach of police protocol and public trust<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The family of Ms Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025 at the age of 41, has called for a full investigation into how Prince Andrew obtained her private information<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Her brother, Sky Roberts, has also publicly urged King Charles III to go further and strip Prince Andrew of his birthright title of ‘Prince’<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The timing of the new police probe is significant, coinciding with the imminent publication of Ms Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, which is due to be released shortly after the latest revelations<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The book is reported to contain further explosive claims, including an allegation that she lost her baby days after participating in an orgy with Prince Andrew and eight other girls at Jeffrey Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St James, which she referred to as 'Little Saint Jeff’s'<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Prince Andrew has consistently and vigorously denied all sexual allegations made against him<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>.</p>

        <section>
           <h2>The Final Stripping of Royal Titles</h2>
           <p>The new police investigation follows a dramatic week for the royal family, which culminated in Prince Andrew’s agreement to relinquish his remaining royal titles and honours on 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles III, marked the completion of the prince’s withdrawal from public royal life, a process that began six years earlier<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The titles he agreed to put in abeyance included the Duke of York, a title bestowed upon him by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on the morning of his wedding in 1986<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. He also relinquished his associated honours, including his role as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The immediate catalyst for this final step was the emergence of further correspondence that contradicted his long-held public narrative regarding his friendship with the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. During his disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC’s *Newsnight* programme, Prince Andrew had claimed he had cut off all contact with Epstein in December 2010<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. However, emails surfaced last week suggesting he was still in contact with the disgraced financier in February 2011, months after the alleged break<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. One message, reportedly sent on 28 February 2011, allegedly showed Prince Andrew messaging Epstein following the publication of the photograph with Ms Giuffre, stating they were “in this together” and would “have to rise above it”<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Another message, sent months after their alleged separation, concluded with the phrase: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The revelation of this correspondence was considered the ‘last straw’ for the House of Windsor, which had been attempting to insulate the monarchy from the years of scandal<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. In a personal statement released on 17 October 2025, Prince Andrew said that the “continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family”<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. He added that he had decided to “put my duty to my family and country first” and that he would no longer use his titles or honours with the King’s agreement<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. While he will no longer use the titles, he retains his status as a Prince, a birthright as the son of a monarch, and the dukedom itself, which can only be formally removed by an Act of Parliament<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also lose the use of the Duchess of York title<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This latest move follows the initial, more significant stripping of his public roles in January 2022, when Queen Elizabeth II removed his honorary military titles and royal patronages, and he ceased using his ‘His Royal Highness’ style in an effort to distance the institution from the impending civil lawsuit<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The decision to remove the remaining titles was reportedly made in consultation with King Charles III and Prince William, the Prince of Wales, who is said to have wanted his father to take a firmer line with his younger brother<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Shadow of Jeffrey Epstein and the Civil Suit</h2>
           <p>The current crisis is the latest chapter in a long-running saga that began with Prince Andrew’s close friendship with the American financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The friendship came under intense scrutiny following Epstein’s second arrest in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking, and his subsequent death by suicide in a New York jail cell<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Virginia Giuffre, who was one of Epstein’s victims, alleged that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions in the early 2000s, including once in London at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate, when Ms Giuffre was 17 years old<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on 9 August 2021, under New York’s Child Victims Act<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The lawsuit alleged sexual assault and sought unspecified damages<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Prince Andrew’s legal team repeatedly denied the allegations, stating that their client “unequivocally denies Giuffre’s false allegations” and attempted to have the case dismissed<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. His lawyers argued that a previously secret 2009 settlement between Ms Giuffre and Epstein, which included a $500,000 (£360,000) payment, should absolve Andrew and other ‘potential defendants’ from liability<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. However, on 12 January 2022, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected the prince’s attempts to dismiss the case, allowing the sexual abuse lawsuit to proceed toward a trial<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The prospect of the prince giving sworn evidence in a trial, which would have been a profound humiliation for the royal family, led to an out-of-court settlement<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. On 15 February 2022, lawyers for both parties filed a letter to the court announcing they had reached a “settlement in principle”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The settlement was for an undisclosed sum, though international lawyers estimated the cost to Prince Andrew was likely to be more than $10 million (£7 million), not including his own legal fees<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The final court documents, a “Stipulation of Dismissal,” were filed on 7 March 2022, officially ending the civil action<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Crucially, the settlement included no admission of guilt from Prince Andrew, who has always maintained his innocence<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. However, the joint statement filed to the court contained a significant concession: Prince Andrew acknowledged that Ms Giuffre had “suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. He also pledged to make a “substantial donation” to Ms Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights and expressed regret for his association with Epstein<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, stated that the settlement was a victory for his client, who had secured an acknowledgement of her suffering<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The settlement, which was paid in March 2022, was reported to be as much as £12 million, leading to public calls for the prince to confirm how he funded the payment<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Unravelling of a Public Life</h2>
           <p>The events of 2025 represent the culmination of a long and steady unravelling of Prince Andrew’s public life, which began in earnest with the 2019 *Newsnight* interview<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The interview, conducted by Emily Maitlis, was intended to clear the prince’s name and counter the media reports about his friendship with Epstein<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Instead, it was widely criticised for his lack of empathy for Epstein’s victims and his offering of explanations for his friendship that were deemed unbelievable by the public<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. His claim that he could not have been at the London nightclub Tramp on the night Ms Giuffre alleged because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking for a party with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, became a subject of widespread ridicule<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Furthermore, his assertion that he could not sweat due to an ‘adrenaline condition’ following his service in the Falklands War was offered as a defence against Ms Giuffre’s claim that he was ‘sweating profusely’ while dancing<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The immediate aftermath of the broadcast saw a swift and decisive reaction from Buckingham Palace and the public<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. On 20 November 2019, Buckingham Palace announced that Prince Andrew would suspend all royal duties “for the foreseeable future,” and four days later, he was stripped of his role as patron of 230 charities<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The final, formal removal of his military affiliations and the use of his HRH style came in January 2022, just before the civil lawsuit was due to proceed<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The pressure on the prince did not abate, even after the settlement. King Charles III, who ascended the throne in 2022, has reportedly taken a firm line with his younger brother<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. In 2024, the King reportedly stopped funding Prince Andrew’s private security costs and has been reported as attempting to move the prince and his ex-wife out of their Windsor residence, Royal Lodge<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The latest revelations, including the alleged email to Epstein in 2011 and the claims of pressuring a police officer, have ensured that the scandal will not soon evaporate, despite the prince’s removal from public life<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The call from Ms Giuffre’s family to strip him of his princely title demonstrates the continued public and political pressure for a complete and final separation of the monarchy from the controversy<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The Metropolitan Police’s decision to ‘actively look into’ the claims of misuse of a protection officer represents a significant escalation, moving the matter from the realm of royal scandal and civil litigation into a potential criminal inquiry concerning the conduct of a public servant and the prince’s alleged influence<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The Metropolitan Police’s decision to investigate the claims that Prince Andrew sought to use a state-funded protection officer to gather personal, potentially damaging, information on Virginia Giuffre marks a new and serious phase in the long-running controversy<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The inquiry into the alleged misuse of public resources for a private smear campaign follows the prince’s recent relinquishing of his remaining royal titles, a move that was itself a direct consequence of newly emerged correspondence contradicting his account of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Despite the 2022 out-of-court settlement of the civil lawsuit, which saw Prince Andrew make no admission of guilt but acknowledge Ms Giuffre’s suffering, the shadow of the Epstein scandal continues to define his public standing<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The ongoing scrutiny, amplified by the imminent publication of Ms Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, ensures that the royal family’s efforts to contain the damage caused by the former Duke of York remain a central challenge to the monarchy’s reputation<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The focus has now shifted from the civil allegations to the potential criminal implications of his alleged conduct, raising fundamental questions about accountability for members of the royal family and the integrity of the state protection system<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
