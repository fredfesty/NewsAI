            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>On 29 September 2025, a multi-storey building at the Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia, collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 54 individuals, primarily students, and injuring over 100 others. The incident, which occurred during afternoon prayers, has been classified as the country's deadliest disaster of the year. Preliminary investigations suggest that the collapse was caused by structural failure due to unauthorised construction work to add upper floors. This tragedy has cast a harsh spotlight on the widespread issue of illegal and unregulated construction in Indonesia, particularly within the extensive network of religious boarding schools, known as 'pesantren'. The disaster has prompted a national conversation about building safety standards, regulatory enforcement, and the accountability of institutions.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the late afternoon of 29 September 2025, the tranquil routine of the Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school in Sidoarjo, East Java, was irrevocably shattered. As hundreds of students, mostly teenage boys, gathered for Asr prayers, the three-storey prayer hall they occupied catastrophically failed. The structure crumbled, entombing many in a chaotic mass of concrete and steel. The immediate aftermath was a scene of devastation and frantic rescue efforts, as the scale of the tragedy began to unfold. By 6 October 2025, the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) confirmed that 54 people had lost their lives, with many more injured. This event has been recorded as Indonesia's most fatal single-building disaster in 2025. The collapse at Al Khoziny is not merely a localised tragedy; it serves as a stark and painful illustration of systemic issues that plague Indonesia's construction sector, particularly the pervasive lack of adherence to building codes and the inadequacy of regulatory oversight. The incident has raised profound questions about the safety of educational institutions across the archipelago and the urgent need for reform.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>A Venerable Institution and a Fateful Construction</h3>
            <p>The Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school, also known as Pondok Pesantren Al Khoziny, is a long-established and respected educational institution in Buduran, Sidoarjo. Formally founded in 1927, its roots trace back to as early as 1920, making it a century-old centre for Islamic learning. The school is renowned for its adherence to the 'salafi' tradition, which involves intensive study of classical Islamic texts. Over the decades, Al Khoziny has expanded to incorporate formal education levels and now accommodates over 2,000 students, from junior high to higher education.</p>
            <p>The building that collapsed was a 'musalla', or prayer hall, which had been undergoing significant renovation and expansion for approximately nine to ten months. The plan was to transform the existing structure into a three-storey building with a rooftop deck. The lower levels were intended for daily prayers, while the upper floors were designated as meeting halls for the students. This construction was part of a wider, phased renovation project at the pesantren. Crucially, this construction work was being carried out without the necessary permits, a fact later confirmed by the Sidoarjo district chief, Subandi. This lack of official oversight meant that the project was not subject to the mandatory checks and balances designed to ensure structural integrity and safety.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Collapse and the Ensuing Chaos</h3>
            <p>The collapse occurred at approximately 15:00 Western Indonesia Time (WIB) as students were performing the afternoon Asr prayer. At the time, workers were in the process of pouring concrete for the third floor. The immense weight of the wet concrete, coupled with the existing structural deficiencies of the building, proved to be a fatal combination. The foundations and support pillars, unable to bear the load, gave way, leading to a progressive "pancake" collapse, where each floor fell vertically onto the one below. This type of structural failure is particularly devastating as it leaves minimal voids for survival.</p>
            <p>The immediate aftermath was a scene of chaos and horror. Survivors described a sudden, thunderous noise, with some initially mistaking it for an earthquake. Those who were able to escape were met with a scene of utter devastation, with the multi-storey building reduced to a pile of rubble. A massive and complex rescue operation was launched almost immediately, involving over 400 personnel from various agencies, including Basarnas, the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI), the Indonesian National Police (Polri), and numerous volunteer groups. The search for survivors was a race against time, with rescuers working in 24-hour shifts. The nature of the collapse, however, made their task exceptionally difficult. The debris was tightly compacted, leaving very little space for potential survivors. The rescue efforts were further hampered by a 6.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the Sumenep region, approximately 200 kilometres away, on 1 October. The seismic event caused the rubble to settle and compact further, reducing already narrow gaps and complicating the search.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Grim Toll and the Search for the Missing</h3>
            <p>The human cost of the collapse was staggering. As of 6 October 2025, the official death toll stood at 54, which included five unidentified body parts that may belong to the same victims. In addition to the fatalities, 103 people were reported to have sustained injuries. The victims were predominantly students, with ages ranging from 12 to 19. The process of identifying the deceased was a harrowing task for the families and the authorities. The Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) team of the East Java Regional Police was tasked with this solemn responsibility.</p>
            <p>The search and rescue operation was a protracted and emotionally draining process. For days, families of the missing students camped out near the site, anxiously awaiting any news of their loved ones. The initial phase of the rescue focused on locating survivors, with specialised equipment such as life detectors and search cameras being deployed. However, as the days passed and no further signs of life were detected, the operation transitioned into a recovery mission. Heavy machinery, including excavators and jackhammers, was brought in to carefully remove the tons of debris. The decision to use heavy equipment was made after consultation with the families of the missing, as the hope of finding anyone alive dwindled.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>A Systemic Failure: Unregulated Construction and Lax Enforcement</h3>
            <p>The collapse of the Al Khoziny prayer hall is a tragic symptom of a much larger and deeply rooted problem in Indonesia: the prevalence of illegal and unsafe construction practices. Initial investigations and expert analysis pointed towards a catastrophic structural failure caused by the overloading of a building that was not designed to support the additional floors being constructed. Construction experts noted that the building's foundations were inadequate for the load being placed upon them. The fact that students were allowed to use the building while major construction was underway overhead has also been a subject of severe criticism.</p>
            <p>The Sidoarjo district chief confirmed that the school's management had not applied for the requisite building permit (Persetujuan Bangunan Gedung - PBG), which replaced the previous Izin Mendirikan Bangunan (IMB). This is not an isolated case. According to the country's public works minister, Dody Hanggodo, of the approximately 42,000 Islamic boarding schools in Indonesia, only 50 have the necessary building permits. This shocking statistic underscores the scale of the problem and the systemic failure of regulatory enforcement.</p>
            <p>Indonesia has a legal framework for building safety, including Law Number 28 of 2002 concerning Buildings, which has been amended by subsequent regulations. These laws mandate that construction projects must adhere to strict safety standards, including structural integrity, fire safety, and environmental considerations. The Construction Safety Management System (SMKK) is also a legal requirement for all construction companies, designed to identify and mitigate risks. However, the effectiveness of these regulations is severely undermined by a lack of enforcement, particularly in non-urban areas. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, including a lack of resources for inspection and enforcement, a culture of bypassing official procedures, and potentially corruption.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Aftermath: Grief, Anger, and Calls for Accountability</h3>
            <p>The tragedy at Al Khoziny has sent shockwaves across Indonesia, eliciting an outpouring of grief and a surge of public anger. The incident has ignited a national debate on the safety of educational facilities and the urgent need for stricter enforcement of building regulations. In response to the disaster, President Prabowo Subianto ordered a nationwide structural integrity check of all pesantren buildings. He tasked the Coordinating Minister for Community Empowerment, Muhaimin Iskandar, with overseeing the inspections and providing assistance to ensure that pesantren management complies with safety standards.</p>
            <p>The East Java Police have launched a criminal investigation into the collapse to determine whether negligence on the part of the school's management led to the deaths. Under Indonesian law, violations of the building code that result in fatalities can lead to severe penalties, including lengthy prison sentences and substantial fines. The investigation will be a crucial test of the legal system's ability to hold those responsible to account and to deliver justice for the victims and their families.</p>
            <p>The collapse has also highlighted the vital role of pesantren in Indonesian society. These institutions are not just places of learning but are also central to community life, particularly in rural areas. The tragedy has therefore had a profound impact on the local community and has raised concerns about the safety of the millions of students who attend these schools across the country.</p>

            <h3>A Recurring Tragedy: The Broader Context of Building Collapses in Indonesia</h3>
            <p>The Al Khoziny disaster is the latest in a series of fatal building collapses in Indonesia that have exposed the vulnerabilities of the country's built environment. These incidents, which have occurred in various contexts from schools and residential buildings to places of worship, often share common causal factors: substandard construction materials, poor design, a lack of professional supervision, and the flouting of building regulations.</p>
            <p>For instance, in 2019, the roof of a primary school in Pasuruan, East Java, collapsed, killing a teacher and injuring several students. An investigation revealed the use of substandard materials and a lack of proper auditing after a renovation. Such incidents are a stark reminder that the problem of unsafe buildings is not confined to any single type of institution or geographical area.</p>
            <p>The challenge for Indonesia is to translate the lessons from these tragedies into meaningful and lasting reforms. This will require a multi-pronged approach that includes strengthening the capacity of local governments to enforce building codes, raising public awareness about the importance of building safety, and fostering a culture of accountability within the construction industry.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Conclusion: A Moment of Reckoning for Indonesia</h3>
            <p>The collapse of the Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school is a national tragedy that has exposed deep-seated and systemic failures in Indonesia's construction sector and regulatory framework. The loss of so many young lives is a devastating blow to the families and the community of Sidoarjo, and it serves as a solemn warning of the potential consequences of neglecting building safety standards.</p>
            <p>The government's promise of a nationwide audit of pesantren buildings is a welcome first step, but it must be followed by concrete and sustained action. This includes not only identifying and rectifying structural deficiencies in existing buildings but also ensuring that all new construction projects, particularly those for public use, are subject to rigorous and transparent oversight.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the legacy of the Al Khoziny tragedy will be determined by the extent to which it serves as a catalyst for change. If it leads to a genuine and lasting commitment to improving building safety and enforcing the rule of law, then the lives of the 54 individuals who perished in the rubble will not have been lost in vain. The path to reform will be challenging, requiring political will, institutional capacity, and a collective commitment to prioritising human life above all else. For the sake of the victims of Sidoarjo and for the safety of future generations, it is a path that Indonesia must resolutely follow.</p>
