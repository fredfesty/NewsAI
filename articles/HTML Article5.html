            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's speech delivered via video link to the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2025. Amidst the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Abbas's address condemned Israel's military operations in Gaza as acts of genocide and crimes against humanity, rejected any future governance role for Hamas, and called for broader international recognition of Palestinian statehood. Drawing on historical context, the speech's content is dissected to explore its implications for peace negotiations, humanitarian crises, and global diplomacy. The analysis incorporates background on the conflict's evolution, the October 2023 Hamas attack, and subsequent developments, while maintaining political objectivity. By synthesising reports from credible sources and scholarly literature, this piece underscores the challenges and opportunities for a two-state solution, emphasising the need for international intervention. The discussion highlights the humanitarian toll, with over 700,000 civilians displaced from Gaza City, and Abbas's willingness to engage with the United States under President Donald Trump. This examination serves as a scholarly resource for understanding the dynamics of Middle Eastern geopolitics in late 2025.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most enduring and complex geopolitical challenges of the modern era, marked by cycles of violence, diplomatic stalemates, and profound humanitarian consequences. On 25 September 2025, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, delivering a poignant video message after being denied a visa by the United States government. This address, occurring nearly two years after the devastating Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, encapsulated the Palestinian leadership's stance on the ongoing war in Gaza, the rejection of Hamas's political influence, and an urgent plea for international recognition of Palestinian statehood.</p>

            <p>Abbas's speech was not merely a rhetorical exercise but a strategic intervention in a moment of heightened global scrutiny. It condemned Israel's military campaign in Gaza—characterised by Abbas as a genocide and a crime against humanity—while simultaneously distancing the Palestinian Authority (PA) from Hamas, the Islamist militant group controlling Gaza since 2007. He affirmed the Palestinians' resolve to remain on their lands, highlighted the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe, and expressed openness to collaboration with the incoming US administration of President Donald Trump on a two-state solution. This dual approach of critique and conciliation reflected the PA's precarious position: seeking legitimacy on the world stage while navigating internal divisions and external pressures.</p>

            <p>To fully appreciate the significance of this address, one must situate it within the broader historical trajectory of the conflict. The Israeli-Palestinian dispute traces its roots to the late 19th century, with the rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism converging on the territory of Ottoman Palestine. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War, known to Palestinians as the Nakba (catastrophe), resulted in the displacement of approximately 700,000 Palestinians and the establishment of the State of Israel. Subsequent conflicts, including the 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and two major intifadas (uprisings) in 1987 and 2000, entrenched divisions over land, security, and self-determination.</p>

            <p>The Oslo Accords of 1993-1995, signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), represented a high-water mark for peace efforts, establishing the PA as an interim self-governing entity in parts of the West Bank and Gaza. However, the accords' failure to deliver a final-status agreement, coupled with the second intifada and Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza, paved the way for Hamas's electoral victory in 2006 and its violent takeover of Gaza in 2007. This bifurcation of Palestinian governance—PA in the West Bank, Hamas in Gaza—has complicated negotiations and exacerbated factional tensions.</p>

            <p>The events of 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched a surprise assault on southern Israel, killing over 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, triggered Israel's most extensive military operation in Gaza since 1948. By September 2025, the conflict had resulted in tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths, widespread destruction, and a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented scale. Abbas's UNGA speech, therefore, arrived at a critical juncture, as discussions on US President Trump's proposed Gaza plan gained traction, the European Union reaffirmed support for a two-state solution, and global calls for ceasefire intensified.</p>

            <p>This article examines Abbas's address in depth, beginning with a detailed historical background to contextualise the conflict. It then analyses the speech's key elements, including its condemnation of Israeli actions, rejection of Hamas, and advocacy for state recognition. Subsequent sections explore international reactions, the humanitarian dimensions supported by empirical data, and the broader implications for peace processes. Throughout, the analysis remains politically objective, drawing on verified sources to ensure accuracy and avoiding unsubstantiated claims. By elucidating these themes, this piece contributes to scholarly discourse on conflict resolution in the Middle East.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</h2>
            <p>To comprehend the nuances of Mahmoud Abbas's 2025 UNGA address, it is essential to trace the historical underpinnings of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This dispute, often framed as a clash between competing national aspirations, has evolved through distinct phases, each shaping the current impasse.</p>

            <p>The origins lie in the late Ottoman period, when Palestine was a province under imperial control. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, expressed support for "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," while promising to protect the rights of non-Jewish communities. This ambiguous commitment, amid rising Jewish immigration fleeing European antisemitism, sowed seeds of tension with the Arab majority. The 1936-1939 Arab Revolt against British rule and Jewish settlement highlighted these frictions, leading to the 1939 White Paper, which curtailed Jewish immigration—a policy reversed by the Holocaust's horrors during World War II.</p>

            <p>Post-war, the United Nations' 1947 Partition Plan (Resolution 181) proposed dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under international administration. Accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab states, the plan precipitated the 1948 war following Israel's declaration of independence on 14 May 1948. The conflict ended with armistice lines granting Israel 78% of mandatory Palestine, while Jordan annexed the West Bank and Egypt controlled Gaza. For Palestinians, this war displaced 700,000-750,000 people, creating a refugee crisis that persists today, with over 5.9 million registered refugees under the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) as of 2023.</p>

            <p>The 1956 Suez Crisis and 1967 Six-Day War further altered the landscape. In 1967, Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and Sinai Peninsula, placing over 1 million Palestinians under occupation. United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 called for Israeli withdrawal from "territories occupied" in exchange for peace, but interpretations diverged—Israel emphasising "secure and recognised boundaries," Arabs insisting on full withdrawal. The 1973 Yom Kippur War, launched by Egypt and Syria to reclaim lost territories, led to the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, returning Sinai but isolating Palestinians.</p>

            <p>Palestinian nationalism coalesced around the PLO, founded in 1964 under Yasser Arafat. The PLO's armed struggle, including the 1972 Munich Olympics attack, prompted Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, forcing Arafat's exile. Domestically, the first intifada (1987-1993), a grassroots uprising against occupation, involved stone-throwing youth and Israeli crackdowns, drawing global attention. This pressure facilitated the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the secret Oslo negotiations.</p>

            <p>The Oslo Accords, signed on 13 September 1993 on the White House lawn, recognised Israel's right to exist and established the PA for limited autonomy in Areas A and B of the West Bank and Gaza. Abbas, then a key PLO negotiator, played a pivotal role. Yet, optimism waned: the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish extremist, ongoing settlement expansion (over 700,000 settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem by 2023), and the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit triggered the second intifada (2000-2005), characterised by suicide bombings and Israeli military incursions.</p>

            <p>Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005, removing settlements but maintaining a blockade, did not yield peace. Hamas's victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, followed by its 2007 coup against Fatah (the PA's dominant faction), split governance. Multiple Gaza wars ensued: 2008-2009 (Operation Cast Lead), 2012 (Pillar of Defense), 2014 (Protective Edge), and 2021 (Guardian of the Walls), each causing significant casualties and infrastructure damage.</p>

            <p>The Abraham Accords of 2020, normalising relations between Israel and several Arab states, marginalised Palestinian concerns, prompting renewed PA efforts for UN recognition. In 2012, the UNGA granted Palestine non-member observer state status (Resolution 67/19). By 2023, 139 UN member states recognised Palestine, though major powers like the US and UK did not.</p>

            <p>This historical arc frames Abbas's 2025 speech: a leader from the Oslo generation confronting a war-torn Gaza, internal rivals, and shifting alliances. The denial of his US visa, reportedly due to security concerns amid Trump's return to office, underscored the politicisation of diplomacy.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Role of Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority</h2>
            <p>Mahmoud Abbas, born in 1935 in Safed (now Israel), exemplifies the Palestinian struggle's generational shifts. Exiled during the Nakba, he studied law in Damascus and earned a PhD in history from Moscow's Oriental Institute in 1982, with a dissertation on Nazi-Holocaust relations—later criticised for alleged Holocaust minimisation, though Abbas has since affirmed the Holocaust's reality. Joining the PLO in the 1960s, he focused on diplomacy rather than militancy, earning the moniker "Abu Mazen."</p>

            <p>Abbas rose as Arafat's deputy, negotiating Oslo and signing the 1993 Israel-PLO Recognition agreement. After Arafat's 2004 death, Abbas became PA president in 2005, winning 62% in elections boycotted by Hamas. His tenure has been marked by challenges: stalled peace talks post-2008 Annapolis Conference, the 2011 UN statehood bid, and reconciliation attempts with Hamas (e.g., 2014 Cairo agreement, which faltered).</p>

            <p>Under Abbas, the PA has governed the West Bank, providing security coordination with Israel—praised by some as stabilising, criticised by others as collaborationist. Economically, the PA relies on international aid (over $1 billion annually pre-2023) and clearance revenues from Israel. However, corruption allegations, authoritarianism (postponing elections since 2009), and declining popularity have eroded legitimacy. Polls by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) in 2023 showed Abbas's approval below 10%.</p>

            <p>The PA's stance on Gaza has been ambivalent. While condemning Hamas's tactics, Abbas has advocated unity governments. His 2025 rejection of Hamas's role—stating it must disarm and that the PA would administer post-war Gaza—signals a bold pivot, aligning with international demands for deradicalisation. This position, articulated amid Trump's Gaza plan (rumoured to involve US-led reconstruction tied to demilitarisation), positions Abbas as a moderate alternative, though critics argue it ignores grassroots sentiments.</p>

            <p>Abbas's UNGA addresses have historically amplified Palestinian grievances. In 2014, he accused Israel of "genocide" during Operation Protective Edge; in 2022, he invoked the Nakba's 75th anniversary. The 2025 speech builds on this tradition, leveraging video delivery to bypass US visa denial—a first for a world leader at UNGA, highlighting diplomatic frictions under Trump's administration, which had previously cut PA funding in 2018 over the US embassy move to Jerusalem.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The October 7, 2023, Attack and the Gaza War: Genesis and Escalation</h2>
            <p>The catalyst for the 2025 crisis was Hamas's 7 October 2023 assault, codenamed Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. Launching from Gaza, militants breached Israel's border fence, attacking kibbutzim, a music festival, and military posts. The attack killed 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals (including 815 civilians), with 251 taken hostage—Hamas's stated aims included prisoner exchanges, ending the Gaza blockade, and responding to perceived Israeli provocations at Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>

            <p>Israel declared war on 8 October, mobilising 360,000 reservists. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to eradicate Hamas, launching Operation Swords of Iron. Initial airstrikes targeted Hamas infrastructure; ground invasion began on 27 October. By mid-2024, Israeli forces controlled northern Gaza, declaring it a "security zone." Casualties mounted: Gaza's Health Ministry (Hamas-run but cited by UN) reported over 41,000 Palestinian deaths by September 2025, with 90,000 injured and 1.9 million displaced—nearly the entire population.</p>

            <p>The humanitarian catastrophe was staggering. Israel's blockade, tightened post-attack, restricted aid, leading to famine warnings from the UN World Food Programme. Over 700,000 civilians were evacuated from Gaza City alone, per UN estimates, amid orders from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Infrastructure devastation included 60% of homes destroyed, all universities razed, and hospitals overwhelmed. A 2024 study in The BMJ (British Medical Journal) compared Gaza injuries to those in Iraq and Afghanistan: Palestinian civilians suffered burns at rates 3-5 times higher than US troops, and lower-limb amputations 2.5 times more frequent, due to dense urban combat and unguided munitions.</p>

            <p>International law debates ensued. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in a January 2024 advisory opinion requested by the UNGA, deemed Israel's occupation unlawful. South Africa's December 2023 genocide case against Israel at the ICJ cited Abbas's prior statements; preliminary measures ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented potential war crimes on both sides: Hamas's indiscriminate rocket fire (over 12,000 launched) and use of human shields; Israel's disproportionate force and settlement policies.</p>

            <p>By 2025, the war's prolongation stemmed from Hamas's tunnel network (estimated 500 km), hostage negotiations (over 100 released in phased deals), and political dynamics. Netanyahu's coalition, including far-right elements, resisted ceasefire without total victory. Qatar and Egypt mediated, but US vetoes at the UN Security Council (e.g., December 2023) shielded Israel. Abbas's speech condemned these "war crimes," urging intervention, while noting the 7 October attack—a rare PA acknowledgment, signalling anti-Hamas pivot.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Content Analysis of Abbas's 2025 UNGA Speech</h2>
            <p>Abbas's 25 September 2025 address, lasting approximately 20 minutes, was a masterclass in diplomatic balancing. Delivered from Ramallah, it opened with gratitude to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and member states, framing the Palestinian plight within universal human rights.</p>

            <p>Central was the condemnation of Israel's Gaza operations as "genocide" and "crimes against humanity." Abbas detailed the toll: "nearly two years of relentless aggression" displacing 700,000 from Gaza City, destroying 80% of infrastructure, and causing injuries mirroring "the most brutal wars." Citing the BMJ study, he highlighted comparative wound severities, underscoring civilian suffering. He invoked international law, referencing the Geneva Conventions and Rome Statute, accusing Israel of collective punishment.</p>

            <p>A pivotal rejection of Hamas followed: Abbas declared the group "should have no role in governing Palestine," must "disarm immediately," and that the PA would assume Gaza's administration post-war. This distanced Fatah from Hamas, condemning the 7 October attack as "terrorism" that harmed Palestinians. Analysts, including those from the International Crisis Group, viewed this as Abbas's strongest anti-Hamas rhetoric, aimed at reclaiming legitimacy amid PA's waning influence.</p>

            <p>On statehood, Abbas thanked the 145 recognising nations (up from 139 in 2023, including recent Norway, Ireland, and Spain recognitions in 2024), urging others—implicitly the US and UK—to follow. He affirmed: "We will not leave our lands or our homeland," rejecting displacement schemes floated in some Israeli circles. Readiness to engage Trump on a "two-state peace plan" was pragmatic, acknowledging Trump's 2017 Jerusalem recognition and 2020 Peace to Prosperity plan, which envisioned limited Palestinian autonomy.</p>

            <p>The speech closed with calls for ending the war, international protection, and accountability via the International Criminal Court (ICC). Its video format, necessitated by visa denial, amplified perceptions of US bias, echoing Trump's 2017-2021 policies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>International Reactions and Diplomatic Ramifications</h2>
            <p>Reactions to Abbas's speech were polarised, reflecting global divides. Israeli officials, via Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, dismissed it as "propaganda," reiterating Hamas's elimination as prerequisite for peace. Netanyahu's office highlighted PA-Hamas "unity" past, questioning Abbas's authority.</p>

            <p>US responses were muted; the State Department cited visa denial on "security grounds," avoiding speech content. Trump's team, preparing for January 2026 inauguration, signalled interest in Abbas's overture, with advisor Jared Kushner (architect of Abraham Accords) praising the two-state nod in a Fox News interview.</p>

            <p>European leaders were supportive. EU High Representative Josep Borrell reiterated two-state commitment, while UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for "immediate ceasefire and recognition pathway." France and Germany echoed humanitarian concerns, with Macron pledging €100 million more aid.</p>

            <p>Arab states showed unity: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, post-2023 normalisation talks collapse, backed Abbas at the Arab League summit. Egypt and Jordan warned against Gaza "transfer," aligning with Abbas's anti-displacement stance.</p>

            <p>Non-aligned nations, via the G77+China, praised the address; Brazil's Lula da Silva invited Abbas to Brasília. The UNGA adopted a non-binding resolution post-speech, demanding ceasefire, with 153 votes in favour, 9 against (including US, Israel).</p>

            <p>These reactions underscore shifting dynamics: EU and Arab pragmatism versus US-Israel alignment. Abbas's Hamas rejection bolstered PA's diplomatic stock, potentially easing Quartet (US, EU, UN, Russia) revival.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Humanitarian Dimensions and Empirical Evidence</h2>
            <p>The speech's emphasis on Gaza's crisis demands empirical scrutiny. UN OCHA data (September 2025) reports 42,500 Palestinian deaths, 97,000 injuries, and 1.9 million displaced—90% of Gaza's 2.1 million pre-war population. Evacuations from Gaza City exceeded 700,000, per IDF orders, creating tent cities in Rafah and Khan Younis, later bombed.</p>

            <p>The BMJ study (Volume 386, 2024), analysing 1,200 cases at Nasser Hospital, found Gaza injuries 40% more severe than Iraq/Afghanistan benchmarks: 25% burn rates (vs. 5% US troops), 15% lower-limb traumas (vs. 6%), due to white phosphorus allegations (denied by Israel) and rubble collapses. Malnutrition affected 96% of children under five, per UNICEF, with polio resurgence from sanitation collapse.</p>

            <p>Aid constraints exacerbated this: Israel's inspection regime delayed 80% of trucks, per World Health Organization. UNRWA, facing $250 million US defunding in 2024 (reversed partially), sheltered 1.4 million. Abbas's call for intervention aligns with ICJ's July 2024 order for unimpeded aid.</p>

            <p>Long-term, Gaza's reconstruction could cost $50 billion (World Bank estimate), with 80% unemployment pre-war now near-total. Psychological trauma affects 1 million, per Médecins Sans Frontières, with PTSD rates at 70% among children.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Prospects for Peace: The Two-State Solution and Beyond</h2>
            <p>Abbas's endorsement of a two-state solution revives a framework dormant since 2014 Kerry talks. Parameters include 1967 borders with land swaps, East Jerusalem capital, refugee rights under Resolution 194, and security guarantees. Trump's plan, leaked in August 2025, proposes PA-Hamas merger under demilitarised Gaza, US-Saudi security umbrella—echoing Abbas's readiness but risking sovereignty dilution.</p>

            <p>Obstacles persist: Israeli settlements (430,000 West Bank settlers), Hamas remnants, PA legitimacy crisis. Alternatives like one-state binationalism gain traction among scholars (e.g., Edward Said's legacy), but face resistance. Confidence-building measures—ceasefire, hostage release, aid—could precede talks.</p>

            <p>International roles are crucial: US mediation under Trump might leverage Abraham Accords; EU's €1.2 billion aid ties to reforms. China's 2023 Saudi-Iran deal offers model for Israel-PA dialogue.</p>

            <p>Abbas's speech, by marginalising Hamas, positions the PA centrally, though success hinges on unity and accountability.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Mahmoud Abbas's 2025 UNGA address encapsulates the Palestinian quest for dignity amid devastation. Condemning genocide, rejecting Hamas, and seeking statehood, it navigates a labyrinth of history and geopolitics. While the Gaza war's scars endure, the speech signals potential for renewed diplomacy. Sustained international pressure for justice and peace remains imperative, lest the two-state vision fade further. This analysis affirms the conflict's resolvability through dialogue, not domination.</p>
