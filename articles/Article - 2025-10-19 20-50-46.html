            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A new diplomatic push to end the war in Ukraine has been defined by a stark divergence in American and Ukrainian positions, following a series of high-stakes meetings in Washington and a public statement from the US President suggesting Russia should be allowed to retain territories it has seized. This shift in the American stance, which came after a direct conversation with the Russian President, has prompted a forceful appeal from Kyiv to its Western allies to resist the temptation of territorial appeasement.</p>

           <h2>The White House Pivot on Ukrainian Sovereignty</h2>
           <p>The diplomatic landscape surrounding the conflict in Ukraine underwent a significant and sudden transformation in mid-October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. United States President Donald Trump, speaking in an interview with Fox News that aired on 19 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, indicated a willingness to accept Russian territorial gains as a condition for a peace settlement<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The President stated that he expected any agreement between Kyiv and Moscow to involve Russia retaining parts of the Ukrainian territory it has occupied since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. When asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be open to ending the war without taking significant Ukrainian land, Mr Trump responded, “Well, he’s going to take something”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. He elaborated on this position by saying, “I mean, they fought and he has a lot of property. I mean, you know… he’s won certain property”<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. This public declaration marked a notable reversal from the President’s earlier, more hawkish rhetoric in September 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. At that time, Mr Trump had publicly encouraged Ukraine to continue fighting to reclaim all occupied land and had even floated the possibility of supplying Kyiv with Tomahawk cruise missiles<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The new position, which appeared to accept the principle that military conquest could define national borders, was further cemented in a social media post following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. In the post, Mr Trump called for a peace deal “with property lines being defined by War and Guts”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. He urged both sides to “stop where they are” and “let History decide”<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The US President also expressed concern about depleting American weapons stocks, stating that the United States could not give Ukraine all the weapons it wanted because Washington needed them for its own defence<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. This sentiment was a clear signal that the long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles sought by Kyiv would not be forthcoming<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Kremlin's Negotiating Position</h2>
           <p>The shift in the American President’s public stance followed a two-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on 16 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Reports from senior officials familiar with the details of the call, as cited by The Washington Post, indicated that Mr Putin had used the conversation to outline his specific territorial demands for a peace settlement<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The Russian leader allegedly demanded that Ukraine surrender full control of the Donetsk region, a strategically vital area in eastern Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. In exchange for this concession, Mr Putin reportedly hinted at a willingness to withdraw Russian troops from the occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. This proposal was viewed by some White House officials as a sign of progress, noting that it represented a slightly lesser territorial claim than the one Mr Putin had put forward during a previous summit with Mr Trump in Anchorage in August 2025<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. However, a senior European diplomat offered a starkly different assessment, suggesting that the proposal was akin to “trying to sell Ukrainians their own leg”<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The Russian demand for the entire Donetsk region is particularly significant, as Russian forces have been attempting to conquer the territory for over a decade, with Ukrainian forces remaining deeply entrenched in the area<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The Russian President’s alleged willingness to trade parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, regions that Russia partially controls, for the entirety of Donetsk, underscores the strategic importance Moscow places on securing the Donbass region<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The phone call also resulted in an agreement for Mr Trump and Mr Putin to meet in Budapest, Hungary, at an undisclosed date<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This meeting would mark the Russian leader’s first known trip to a European Union country since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The prospect of this bilateral summit, with the stated goal of ending the war, has further intensified the focus on the question of territorial concessions<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. An exiled Russian oil tycoon, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, speaking on 19 October 2025, also suggested that Mr Putin had sent a signal to Mr Trump indicating a readiness for a deal, but one that would inevitably involve ceding land to Russia, specifically the whole of Donbass<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Kyiv's Resistance to Appeasement</h2>
           <p>The diplomatic pressure from Washington coincided with a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the White House on 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The Ukrainian leader had travelled to the United States seeking to secure long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, a weapon system that would allow Kyiv to strike military and energy targets deep inside Russian territory<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Mr Zelenskyy’s delegation left Washington empty-handed, as Mr Trump appeared more focused on brokering a peace deal and expressed reservations about the potential for escalation that the missiles represented<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The US President did not explicitly rule out the transfer of the missiles but was noncommittal, saying he was “looking at it” while citing the need to preserve US weapons stocks<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Following the meeting, Mr Zelenskyy acknowledged the difficulty of the territorial issue, stating that it was the most challenging aspect of the negotiations<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Upon his return from the US trip, the Ukrainian President issued a forceful public statement urging his allies not to appease Russia<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Writing on social media, Mr Zelenskyy declared that “Ukraine will never grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes, and we count on our partners to uphold this very position”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. He called for decisive steps from European and American allies and suggested another meeting of the Europe-led “coalition of the willing”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The Ukrainian position remains firm: any peace plan that formalises Russian control over occupied regions, including Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk Oblasts, is unacceptable<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The Ukrainian government views the Russian demand for territorial concessions as a reward for aggression and a violation of international law<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The diplomatic push for a ceasefire and a deal comes as Moscow has intensified its attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, using thousands of attack drones, guided aerial bombs, and missiles in recent weeks<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Mr Zelenskyy reported that in the week leading up to 19 October 2025, Russia had used more than 3,270 attack drones, 1,370 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 50 missiles of various types against Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. These attacks, which have left thousands without heating and light, are seen as an attempt to cripple Ukraine’s power grid ahead of the winter<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Ukrainian President’s plea against appeasement is a direct response to the growing pressure from Washington to consider a peace deal that would involve ceding land, a move Kyiv views as a dangerous precedent that would only embolden further Russian aggression<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine have reached a critical juncture, marked by a fundamental disagreement between the United States and Ukraine over the principle of territorial integrity<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. President Trump's public acceptance of Russia's retention of 'certain property'<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> and the reported details of President Putin's demand for the entire Donetsk region<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> have placed immense pressure on Kyiv to consider a peace deal based on the current lines of conflict<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The failure to secure long-range Tomahawk missiles during President Zelenskyy's visit to Washington further underscored the shift in American priorities toward brokering a settlement<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. As the prospect of a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest looms<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, the Ukrainian President's appeal to allies not to 'grant terrorists any bounty for their crimes'<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> highlights the deep chasm between the desire for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the commitment to the foundational principle of national sovereignty<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The coming weeks will determine whether the diplomatic push will lead to a negotiated peace that formalises Russian territorial gains or if Kyiv and its European partners can successfully resist the pressure to appease Moscow<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
