            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>A powerful and rare F3-equivalent tornado tore through the southern Brazilian state of Paraná in November 2025, reducing the town of Rio Bonito do Iguaçu to a scene of catastrophic ruin in a matter of minutes. The storm, which killed at least six people and injured hundreds, was classified as the most severe to strike the state in decades, with wind speeds exceeding 250 kilometres per hour. The devastation left nearly 90 per cent of the small town damaged and displaced approximately a thousand residents, prompting a massive, multi-level government response and a declaration of three days of mourning. The disaster immediately drew attention to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in South America's 'Tornado Alley' and the urgent, complex challenge of climate change adaptation, particularly as the country prepared to host the COP30 climate summit in the Amazon.</p>

           <h2>A Minute of Catastrophe in Paraná</h2>
           <p>The evening of Friday, 7 November 2025, brought a sudden and violent end to the quiet rhythm of life in Rio Bonito do Iguaçu, a municipality of approximately 14,000 residents in the southern Brazilian state of Paraná<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. A powerful tornado, classified by meteorologists as an F3 on the Fujita scale or its Enhanced Fujita equivalent (EF3), descended upon the town, unleashing a torrent of destruction that lasted for less than a minute<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The ferocity of the twister was immediately apparent, with wind speeds estimated to have reached up to 250 kilometres per hour (155 miles per hour)<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The storm's brief passage left a catastrophic trail, with local officials and residents describing the aftermath as resembling a 'war zone' or 'war scene'<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The human toll was immediate and tragic, with at least six people confirmed dead and hundreds more injured<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Five of the fatalities occurred within Rio Bonito do Iguaçu, including a 14-year-old girl, three men aged 49, 57, and 83, and a 47-year-old woman<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. A sixth victim, a 53-year-old man, was reported in the nearby town of Guarapuava, which also experienced heavy damage<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The number of injured people requiring medical attention quickly surpassed 750, with at least ten individuals undergoing surgery and nine remaining in serious condition in the immediate hours following the disaster<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. One person was initially reported missing, adding to the anxiety of the community as search and rescue operations commenced<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The physical destruction was staggering, with civil defence officials estimating that between 80 and 90 per cent of the town suffered some form of damage<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Aerial photographs and drone footage revealed a landscape of flattened homes, schools reduced to rubble, and vehicles tossed aside like toys<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The state's civil defence agency confirmed that more than half of the urban area experienced roof collapses and multiple structural failures, crippling essential services<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Power lines were downed, roads were blocked by debris, and the telecommunications network suffered interruptions, severely complicating initial communication and rescue efforts<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. A local supermarket collapsed, trapping people and further hindering access to essential goods for the surviving population<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The suddenness and intensity of the event, which lasted only about ten minutes, underscored the vulnerability of the region's infrastructure to such extreme weather<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Meteorological Anatomy of a Rare Storm</h2>
           <p>The tornado that struck Paraná was not merely a severe storm but a meteorological anomaly of significant intensity for the region, classified by the Paraná Environmental Monitoring and Technology System (Simepar) as the most severe in the state in decades<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Southern Brazil, along with parts of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, sits within a geographical area often referred to as South America's 'Tornado Alley'<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. While tornadoes are not absent from this region, the most frequently reported intensities are typically F1 and F2, making the confirmed F3/EF3 rating of the Rio Bonito do Iguaçu event particularly notable<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The formation of this powerful twister was attributed to a classic, yet volatile, atmospheric interaction<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. A mass of warm, humid air, originating from the Amazon rainforest to the north, collided with a strong cold front advancing from the south<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This collision was driven by an extratropical cyclone, a large-scale low-pressure system<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The resulting atmospheric conditions favoured the development of a supercell, a type of thunderstorm characterised by a deep, persistent rotating updraft<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The warm air increased the thermodynamic instability, which, when combined with the sharp drop in temperature from the cold front, created the ideal environment for the formation of the intense, rotating column of air<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The same broad weather pattern was responsible for other severe storms in the region, including at least three other tornadoes reported in the neighbouring state of Santa Catarina<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The event served as a stark reminder of the region's susceptibility to severe weather, which has seen an increasing trend in the number of reported tornadoes, although some of this increase is also attributed to improved observation and reporting procedures<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The scientific community has noted that the documentation of the synoptic-mesoscale environments that favour tornadic storms in Brazil remains relatively poor, with research often limited to case studies of events that cause significant social and economic impact<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Immediate Response and Humanitarian Crisis</h2>
           <p>In the wake of the disaster, the response from local, state, and federal authorities was swift, though hampered by the scale of the destruction<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Paraná Governor Carlos Massa Ratinho Jr. immediately declared a state of emergency in the affected region and announced three days of official mourning to honour the deceased<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. More than 50 firefighters, along with teams from the Civil Defense and the Brazilian Army, were mobilised to conduct search and rescue operations through the rubble, a task made perilous by the structural instability of the remaining buildings<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The immediate priority was the humanitarian crisis, as approximately 1,000 residents were displaced and left homeless<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Temporary shelters were rapidly established in nearby towns, such as Laranjeiras do Sul, utilising gyms and schools to house the affected families<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The state government, in coordination with federal agencies, began dispatching essential aid, including trucks loaded with food, blankets, drinking water, and hygiene products<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Federal support was quickly pledged by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who expressed his condolences and assured the population of the central government's full support for relief and reconstruction efforts<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. A high-level delegation, including the Institutional Relations Minister, Gleisi Hoffmann, and the Acting Health Minister, Adriano Massuda, was dispatched to the area to coordinate the federal response on the ground<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The financial burden of the recovery was immediately addressed, with the Paraná State Public Calamity Fund releasing an initial R$50 million in emergency funds<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Furthermore, the state government submitted a bill proposing a direct payment of up to 50,000 reais (approximately 9,400 US dollars) to each family affected by the storm, a measure intended to provide immediate assistance for rebuilding lives<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Initial estimates of the total economic losses pointed to figures in the tens of millions of reais, with authorities suggesting the final cost of reconstruction could reach hundreds of millions<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The damage extended beyond residential areas, impacting schools, health units, and the sewage network, necessitating a comprehensive and costly long-term reconstruction plan<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Broader Climate Context and Global Diplomacy</h2>
           <p>The devastating tornado in Paraná occurred at a moment of heightened global focus on climate change, adding a stark, immediate reality to the diplomatic discussions underway in Brazil<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The disaster struck just as the country was preparing to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP30, in Belém, a city in the northern state of Pará<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The juxtaposition of a catastrophic weather event in the south with a major climate summit in the north underscored the national and global challenge of adapting to a changing climate<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Climate scientists and meteorologists have increasingly pointed to the role of global warming in exacerbating the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worldwide<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Warmer temperatures and increased moisture in the atmosphere contribute to greater atmospheric instability and wind shear, which are the fundamental ingredients for the formation of powerful twisters like the one that struck Rio Bonito do Iguaçu<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The Paraná tornado was not an isolated incident in the recent history of southern Brazil<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Just the previous year, the region experienced catastrophic flooding in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, a disaster that resulted in over 200 deaths and displaced two million people, which experts also linked to the effects of global warming<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The increasing occurrence of large storms, extratropical cyclones, and intense rainfall in the southern states of Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul highlights a worrying trend of climate variability<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The need for improved early warning systems and more resilient infrastructure has become a critical national security and economic priority<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The destruction in Rio Bonito do Iguaçu served as a visceral, real-time example of the human cost of climate instability, providing a grim backdrop to the international negotiations on climate action and adaptation that were simultaneously taking place hundreds of miles away<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The powerful tornado that tore through Rio Bonito do Iguaçu in November 2025 delivered a devastating blow to a small community, leaving a permanent scar on the landscape of Paraná and the lives of its residents<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The immediate aftermath was defined by the resilience of the community and the coordinated efforts of rescue teams, who worked tirelessly to recover the missing and provide aid to the hundreds injured and displaced<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The state and federal governments' rapid deployment of emergency funds and reconstruction plans, including direct financial aid to affected families, demonstrated a commitment to a long and challenging recovery<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Beyond the immediate crisis, the F3-equivalent storm, classified as the most severe in the state in decades, forced a national conversation about the escalating threat of extreme weather in South America's 'Tornado Alley'<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The event's timing, coinciding with the COP30 climate summit, served as a potent, tragic illustration of the urgent need for global and local strategies to address climate change and build greater resilience against increasingly frequent and intense meteorological phenomena<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The long-term challenge for Brazil lies not only in rebuilding the physical structures of Rio Bonito do Iguaçu but also in adapting its national infrastructure and disaster preparedness to a new, more volatile climate reality<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p>
