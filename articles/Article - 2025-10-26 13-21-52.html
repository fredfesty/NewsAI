            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>The erroneous release of Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian national convicted of sexual assault, from HMP Chelmsford triggered a two-day national manhunt and exposed a critical failure in the prison and probation service's release protocols. The incident, which occurred despite the man's imminent deportation order, has prompted a high-level government investigation and renewed scrutiny of the UK's asylum and penal systems.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Conviction and the Deportation Order</h2>
           <p>Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an Ethiopian national, arrived in the United Kingdom via a small boat in June 2025 and was subsequently housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as an asylum seeker<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Just days after his arrival, he committed a series of sexual offences in the local area<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The offences, which took place in July, included sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Kebatu was found guilty of five offences following a three-day trial at Chelmsford and Colchester magistrates' courts in September<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The charges included two counts of sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and harassment without violence<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. During the trial, the court heard that Kebatu had made inappropriate comments to the teenage girl, attempted to kiss her, and later sexually assaulted a woman who tried to intervene, putting his hand on her leg and attempting to kiss her<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. District Judge Christopher Williams sentenced Kebatu to 12 months in prison, noting that he posed a “significant risk of reoffending” and had acted “ignorantly and repulsively”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The judge also imposed a five-year sexual harm prevention order and ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders Register for ten years<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Having received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months, the foreign national offender was subject to a mandatory deportation order under the UK Borders Act 2007<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The court was informed that it was Kebatu’s “firm wish” to be deported<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Procedural Failure at HMP Chelmsford</h2>
           <p>The critical failure occurred on a Friday in late October 2025 at His Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Chelmsford, where Kebatu had served only 31 days of his sentence<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Instead of being transferred to an immigration detention centre for immediate deportation, the 38-year-old was mistakenly released from the prison<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Reports indicated that he was wrongly categorised as a prisoner due to be released on licence, a procedural error that allowed him to walk free<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. A witness, a delivery driver named Sim, described seeing Kebatu return to the prison reception in a “very confused” state “four or five times” over a 90-minute period<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The witness claimed that prison staff repeatedly turned him away, directing him toward the railway station<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Kebatu reportedly left the prison with a small amount of personal money, though a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman later clarified he was not given the standard discharge grant, which is not provided to inmates due for deportation<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The Prison Service was alerted to the erroneous release on Friday afternoon, but Kebatu had already boarded a train at Chelmsford railway station at 12:41 pm, heading for London<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Manhunt and Recapture</h2>
           <p>The mistaken release of a convicted sex offender who was due for deportation immediately triggered a high-priority manhunt<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Responsibility for the operation was handed to the Metropolitan Police, with support from Essex Police and the British Transport Police<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Authorities released CCTV images of Kebatu, who was initially seen wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit and carrying a white bag with avocado pictures<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. He was tracked taking a train from Chelmsford to Stratford in east London, arriving at 1:10 pm on the day of his release, and was later spotted in the Dalston area of Hackney<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The police made a direct appeal to the public for information and to Kebatu himself to surrender safely<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The two-day search concluded on the following Sunday morning when Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area of north London at approximately 8:30 am<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The arrest followed a tip-off from a member of the public who had spotted a man matching his description near Finsbury Park station<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Metropolitan Police Commander James Conway praised the “diligent and fast-paced investigation” and thanked the public for their assistance<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Kebatu was detained on suspicion of being unlawfully at large and was to be returned to the custody of the Prison Service<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Political Fallout and Systemic Failures</h2>
           <p>The incident was immediately condemned by senior government figures, who described the mistake as an “egregious failure”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the mistaken release “totally unacceptable” and ordered an investigation to establish what went wrong<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed that he was “livid and appalled” by the blunder and ordered the immediate strengthening of release checks across the prison estate<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, confirmed that Kebatu would be deported “as quickly as possible”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The Prison Service launched its own investigation, and a prison officer was suspended from discharging duties pending the outcome<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Criminal Justice Workers’ Union (CJWU) general secretary, Mike Rolfe, suggested the failure was symptomatic of a justice system “stretched to breaking point”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The father of the teenage victim stated that the justice system had “let us down”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The case also drew attention to the broader issue of erroneous releases within the prison system<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Official figures from His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) showed that 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This figure represented a 128 per cent increase from the 115 erroneous releases recorded in the previous 12 months, marking the highest number in the time series<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The re-arrest of Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu brought a swift end to a two-day period of public anxiety, but the underlying systemic failures remain a profound concern<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The erroneous release of a convicted sex offender who was due for deportation, compounded by reports that he attempted to return to the prison, highlights a critical breakdown in communication and procedure at HMP Chelmsford<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Beyond the immediate political fallout and the promise of an investigation, the incident has underscored the increasing strain on the UK’s prison system, which has seen a significant rise in the number of prisoners released by mistake<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The government now faces the challenge of restoring public confidence in the integrity of the penal and immigration systems while ensuring that the promised strengthening of release checks is robust enough to prevent a recurrence of such a serious and embarrassing failure<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
