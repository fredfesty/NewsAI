            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>In the spring of 2023, a legal confrontation that had been brewing since the contentious 2020 US presidential election reached a dramatic and costly conclusion.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> Just as a landmark defamation trial was set to commence, Fox News agreed to a settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, paying an historic sum of $787.5 million.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> The case revolved around the network's broadcasting of baseless conspiracy theories alleging that Dominion's voting machines had been manipulated to steal the election.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Pre-trial discoveries unearthed a trove of internal communications, revealing that many of Fox News's most prominent executives and on-air personalities were privately aware that the claims they were airing were false.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> The settlement, one of the largest in media defamation history, allowed the network to avoid a public trial that would have seen its biggest stars and its chairman, Rupert Murdoch, testify under oath.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> While Fox News acknowledged a court ruling that found certain claims about Dominion to be false, it was not required to issue an on-air apology.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The resolution underscored the profound financial and reputational consequences of disseminating misinformation and raised critical questions about media accountability in a polarised era.<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The network's legal troubles are not over, as it still faces a similar, larger lawsuit from another voting technology company, Smartmatic.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></p>

           <h2>An Abrupt End in Wilmington</h2>
           <p>On 18 April 2023, the stage was set in a Delaware Superior Court for what was anticipated to be one of the most significant media trials in American history.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> A jury had been selected, and opening statements were moments away in the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> The case, filed in March 2021, accused the network of knowingly broadcasting false and damaging claims that its voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> The trial was expected to last up to six weeks and feature testimony from Fox News's most recognisable on-air personalities and its highest-ranking executives, including chairman Rupert Murdoch.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> Instead, after an unexpected delay of several hours that fuelled intense speculation, Judge Eric M. Davis entered the courtroom to announce that the parties had resolved their case.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> Fox News had agreed to pay Dominion $787.5 million, a staggering figure that ranks among the largest-ever settlements in a US defamation case.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> In a statement, Fox News acknowledged the court's prior rulings which found certain claims about Dominion to be false.<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> The network expressed hope that the amicable resolution would allow the country to move forward.<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> Dominion's CEO, John Poulos, stated that Fox had admitted to telling lies that caused enormous damage to his company and its employees.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> The settlement, however, did not require Fox News to apologise on-air for broadcasting the falsehoods.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></p>

           <h2>The Genesis of the Allegations</h2>
           <p>In the weeks following the November 2020 presidential election, a torrent of unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud emerged.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> Fox News became a primary platform for amplifying these theories, particularly those targeting Dominion Voting Systems, a company whose technology was used in 28 states during the election.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Guests on the network, including attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, repeatedly made baseless allegations.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> These included claims that Dominion was founded in Venezuela to rig elections for Hugo Chávez, that its software could switch votes from one candidate to another, and that it had paid kickbacks to government officials.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> These statements were broadcast across various Fox News and Fox Business programmes hosted by prominent figures such as Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> Federal and state officials found no evidence to support any claims that voting systems had deleted or changed votes in the 2020 election.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Dominion argued that by giving these falsehoods a prominent platform, Fox News lent them an air of credibility they did not deserve, causing severe harm to the company's reputation and business.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> The lawsuit, filed in Delaware where both companies are incorporated, contended that Fox News either knew the statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Mountain of Damning Evidence</h2>
           <p>The strength of Dominion's case became overwhelmingly apparent during the pre-trial discovery phase.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> A vast collection of internal Fox News communications, including text messages, emails, and deposition testimony, was made public in a series of court filings.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> This evidence revealed a stark contrast between what the network's stars and executives were saying privately and what they were broadcasting to millions of viewers.<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> In a text message to fellow host Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson wrote of Sidney Powell, "Sidney Powell is lying."<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Sean Hannity stated in his deposition that he "did not believe it for one second" when Powell asserted on his show that Dominion machines had been rigged.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> Laura Ingraham, in a message exchange with Carlson and Hannity, referred to Powell as "a bit nuts".<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> The communications also showed a deep concern among Fox personnel about losing viewers to rival conservative networks like Newsmax, which were more aggressively promoting the stolen election narrative.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Following the network's correct but controversial call of Arizona for Joe Biden on election night, executives worried about audience backlash.<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott told Lachlan Murdoch that the Arizona call "was damaging but we will highlight our stars and plant flags letting the viewers know we hear them and respect them."<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> Perhaps most critically, Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch acknowledged in his deposition that some of his network's most prominent hosts had endorsed the false narrative of a stolen election.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> He admitted he could have stopped guests like Giuliani and Powell from appearing on the network's programmes, but did not.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> Murdoch also conceded that the claims were "terrible stuff damaging everybody".<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The 'Actual Malice' Standard</h2>
           <p>To win its case, Dominion had to meet the high legal bar for defamation of a public figure in the United States, a standard established by the landmark 1964 Supreme Court case *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> This required proving that Fox News acted with "actual malice," meaning the network either knew the statements it aired were false or acted with a reckless disregard for whether they were true or not.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup> Fox News's defence rested on the argument that it was merely reporting on newsworthy allegations made by a sitting president and his legal team, a right protected by the First Amendment.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> However, this position was significantly weakened by the pre-trial rulings of Judge Eric M. Davis.<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> On 31 March 2023, Judge Davis granted a summary judgment in favour of Dominion on a key point, ruling that it was "crystal clear that none of the statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true".<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> This meant the central question for the jury at trial would not be whether the claims were false, but whether Fox News had acted with actual malice when it broadcast them.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> The judge also rejected Fox's argument that it was protected by a "neutral report privilege," which can shield journalists who report newsworthy allegations.<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> The mountain of internal communications showing that Fox personnel privately disbelieved the very claims they were airing provided Dominion with powerful evidence to argue that the "actual malice" standard had been met.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Aftermath and Lingering Consequences</h2>
           <p>The $787.5 million payment represented a significant financial blow to Fox Corporation, which held about $4 billion in cash at the time of the settlement.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> The sum effectively erased more than half of the company's profits from the previous year.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> In the immediate aftermath, Fox News's stock value saw a decline.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> Less than a week after the settlement, on 24 April 2023, Fox News announced the abrupt departure of its highest-rated prime-time host, Tucker Carlson.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> While the network has not officially linked his firing to the Dominion case, it came shortly after revelations from a separate lawsuit filed by a former producer, Abby Grossberg, who alleged a toxic work environment on his show and claimed she was pressured to give misleading testimony in the Dominion depositions.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> Carlson himself has claimed he was taken off the air as a condition of the settlement, a charge that both Fox News and Dominion have denied.<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> The network's legal challenges are far from over.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> It still faces a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit from another voting technology company, Smartmatic, which alleges it was similarly maligned by false election claims on the network.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> Rupert Murdoch was deposed in that case in November 2023.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> Fox also faces lawsuits from shareholders who argue the company's board breached its duties by allowing the network to broadcast falsehoods that damaged the company.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></p>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The settlement between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News stands as a landmark event in the intersection of media, law, and politics.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> By securing a payment of $787.5 million, Dominion achieved a significant measure of accountability for the reputational and financial harm it suffered.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> The case exposed a profound disconnect between the private knowledge of a major media organisation and its public pronouncements, revealing a willingness to broadcast information that its own executives and hosts knew to be false.<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup> While the settlement averted a trial that would have provided a fuller public airing of the network's internal workings, the evidence unearthed during discovery offered an unprecedented view into the decision-making processes at Fox News.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> The outcome demonstrated that even with the robust protections for speech afforded by the First Amendment, there are tangible and severe consequences for defamatory falsehoods.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> Yet, the absence of a mandated on-air retraction or apology left some observers questioning the ultimate impact on the audience that consumed the misinformation.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> As Fox News continues to navigate further legal challenges, including the substantial lawsuit from Smartmatic, the Dominion case serves as a powerful testament to the high price of propagating baseless claims in a deeply divided information landscape.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup></p>
