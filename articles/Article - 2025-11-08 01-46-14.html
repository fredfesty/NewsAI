            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The midday calm of Friday prayers at a Jakarta high school was violently disrupted on 7 November 2025, when multiple explosions tore through its mosque, injuring dozens of students. The incident at State Senior High School 72, located in the northern Kelapa Gading neighbourhood, immediately triggered a major security response and a frantic search for answers. Authorities quickly identified a 17-year-old student from the school as the primary suspect, who was himself injured in the blasts. As investigators from Indonesia's elite Densus 88 counter-terrorism unit began their work, the attack raised urgent questions about the motives behind such an act in a place of worship and learning. The discovery of toy weapons, one reportedly bearing white supremacist slogans, added a bewildering layer to the investigation, which is exploring personal grievances such as bullying alongside the possibility of extremist influence. The event has cast a harsh spotlight on the vulnerability of educational institutions and the persistent challenge of youth radicalisation in Indonesia.</p>

           <h2>An Act of Violence in a Sacred Space</h2>
           <p>On Friday, 7 November 2025, the routine of midday prayers at the mosque within State Senior High School 72 (SMAN 72) in Jakarta was irrevocably broken. At approximately 12:15 local time, just as the sermon was beginning, at least two loud explosions occurred. The blasts, which originated from inside and outside the mosque near its loudspeaker system, sent grey smoke billowing through the building. Panic erupted among the gathered students and staff. Videos later circulated on social media showing students in uniform running across the school's basketball court, some covering their ears in terror.<br><br>The school is located in the Kelapa Gading neighbourhood of North Jakarta, within a naval compound that is home to many military personnel and retired officers. The attack resulted in at least 54 people being injured, the majority of whom were students. Emergency services rushed the victims to nearby hospitals, including Cempaka Putih Islamic Hospital and YARSI Hospital. While many were treated for minor injuries and discharged, about 33 students remained hospitalised for more serious conditions, including burns, hearing damage, and wounds from flying glass and other fragments. One student described how the explosion threw nails into the air, injuring several of his friends. Another student, an 11th-grader named Zainal Arifin, suffered multiple shrapnel wounds across his body and required surgery for severe burns to his shoulder and face.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Student Suspect Emerges</h2>
           <p>In the immediate aftermath, attention quickly turned to identifying the perpetrator. Authorities soon announced that the primary suspect was a 17-year-old male student from the school. National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo confirmed that the suspect was among those injured in the blasts and was undergoing surgery, which delayed his questioning. The student, identified only as F, was later moved to an intensive care unit at Yarsi Hospital due to the severity of his head injuries.<br><br>Investigators began delving into the suspect's background and potential motives. Police confirmed they were investigating reports from local media and fellow students that the suspect was a Grade 12 student who had been subjected to bullying and may have been seeking revenge. Some pupils described the suspect as a "loner" who often created drawings depicting violence. He was reportedly found lying on the ground after the explosions. Authorities acknowledged the challenges in gathering information from witnesses, as many were also victims requiring medical treatment and psychological support. The Jakarta police spokesperson, Budi Hermanto, stated that authorities were providing "trauma healing" for affected students and teachers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Investigation Unfolds</h2>
           <p>The crime scene was quickly secured by police, including the Gegana bomb disposal unit from the Mobile Brigade Corps, who conducted a thorough sweep to ensure no other explosive devices remained. The investigation is a joint effort involving the Jakarta Metropolitan Police and Indonesia's elite counter-terrorism unit, Densus 88, which is examining any potential links to terrorism. The involvement of Densus 88 underscores the seriousness with which the authorities are treating the incident.<br><br>Several perplexing items were recovered from the scene. Police found toy firearms, including what appeared to be a toy submachine gun and other replica rifles. Disturbingly, one of the toy guns was reportedly inscribed with white supremacist slogans, including the name of Brenton Tarrant, the perpetrator of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. Investigators also reportedly found a homemade bomb, a remote, and an airsoft gun at the site. One item being analysed was a soda can believed to have been part of a homemade explosive device. Despite these findings, officials urged the public not to speculate about the motive or to immediately label the incident a terrorist act until the investigation is complete.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Disquieting Echo of Youth Radicalisation</h2>
           <p>While the specific motive in the SMAN 72 attack remains under investigation, the incident has reignited concerns about the vulnerability of young people in Indonesia to extremist ideologies. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, has a long history of battling terrorism, from the 2002 Bali bombings carried out by the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah to more recent attacks claimed by Islamic State (IS) affiliates. Historically, these attacks have targeted Western interests, churches, or state authorities, making an attack on a mosque, particularly within a school, a shocking development.<br><br>Recent studies have indicated a worrying trend of radical sentiment among Indonesian youth. A 2017 survey by the Wahid Foundation found that a significant percentage of high school students in Islamic organisations were willing to engage in jihad in conflict zones. Another study from the same year by Jakarta Islamic State University's Center for the Study of Islam and Society found that a high proportion of students surveyed held extremist and intolerant views. Experts have warned that militant groups like Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), which is linked to IS, are actively recruiting young people through social media, using propaganda and even providing instructions on how to build explosives. The potential for radicalisation is not confined to students; it can also extend to teachers and the educational materials used in schools. The rise of online networks, such as the ISIS-linked JAD Nusantara, has exposed gaps in child protection, as vulnerable adolescents dealing with issues like bullying or isolation are targeted for recruitment.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The explosions at SMAN 72 have left a community in shock and a nation grappling with difficult questions. The attack shattered the perceived safety of a school and a place of worship, turning a moment of prayer into one of terror. As the 17-year-old suspect lies in intensive care, the investigation must navigate a complex web of potential motives, from personal grievances like bullying to the insidious influence of global extremist narratives. The presence of a toy gun referencing a notorious white supremacist attacker adds a deeply disturbing and confusing element, highlighting the unpredictable nature of modern radicalisation, which can draw from disparate and conflicting ideologies. Ultimately, the incident at the Jakarta high school serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat of extremism and the critical need to address the underlying vulnerabilities that can lead a young person down a path of violence. For the students, teachers, and parents of SMAN 72, the road to recovery will be long, marked by the need for both physical and psychological healing.</p>
