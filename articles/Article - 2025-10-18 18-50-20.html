            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>The Duke of York's formal agreement to cease using all his remaining royal titles and honours, including the Dukedom of York, marks the definitive conclusion of a six-year process of public withdrawal. This decision, made in consultation with King Charles III, follows renewed scrutiny over his long-standing association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the posthumous publication of a memoir by his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The move effectively renders the prince a private citizen, stripped of all public-facing vestiges of his former life as a senior working royal.</p>

           <h2>The End of a Dukedom</h2>
           <p>On 17 October 2025, a statement released through Buckingham Palace confirmed that Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, would no longer use his royal titles or the honours conferred upon him. The most prominent of these was the title of Duke of York, which had been bestowed upon him by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on the morning of his wedding to Sarah Ferguson in July 1986. The announcement also included the relinquishment of the subsidiary titles, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, and the prestigious role of Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. The decision was presented as a voluntary step by the prince, who stated that the “continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family”. He reiterated his denial of the accusations against him. Crucially, the agreement means the titles are put in abeyance, or dormant, rather than being legally removed. The legal removal of a peerage, such as a dukedom, would require an Act of Parliament, a constitutional process that has not been applied to a senior royal in over a century. The last such instance occurred in 1919, when Prince Charles Edward, a grandson of Queen Victoria, lost his title of Duke of Albany for fighting on the German side during the First World War. The King, who was consulted on the decision, was reportedly pleased with the outcome, which was also made in consultation with the Prince of Wales. The prince's ex-wife, Sarah, will also cease to use the title Duchess of York, and will be known as Sarah Ferguson. The titles of their two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, remain unaffected.</p>

           <h2>A Six-Year Descent from Grace</h2>
           <p>The final severance of the prince’s public ties to the monarchy is the culmination of a six-year period of escalating scandal and withdrawal. The initial crisis point arrived in November 2019 following his interview with Emily Maitlis for the BBC programme *Newsnight*. The interview, intended to clear his name and defend his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was widely condemned as a public relations disaster. During the broadcast, the prince offered a series of explanations for his actions and his relationship with Epstein. He claimed he had no recollection of meeting Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions when she was 17 years old in 2001. The prince also offered a now-infamous defence for his inability to recall a photograph of him with Giuffre, claiming he could not have been sweating at a London nightclub because of a medical condition he developed during his service in the Falklands War. Within days of the interview airing, Queen Elizabeth II ordered her son to step back from public duties “for the foreseeable future”. He subsequently resigned from all 230 of his charitable patronages. The pressure intensified in January 2022 when, as a civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by Giuffre in the United States loomed, the Queen stripped him of all his honorary military affiliations and royal patronages. At that time, he also ceased using the style His Royal Highness (HRH). The prince, who was born in 1960, had previously enjoyed a decorated career in the Royal Navy, serving as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot during the Falklands War in 1982. He was once second in line to the throne, a position that has since shifted to eighth in the line of succession.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Epstein Connection and Legal Fallout</h2>
           <p>The root of the prince’s downfall lies in his long-standing friendship with the American financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex offences involving minors and died by suicide in a Manhattan prison cell in August 2019. The prince first met Epstein in 1999, reportedly through Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted of colluding in Epstein’s sexual abuse. The association continued for years, with Epstein and Maxwell attending a party at Windsor Castle in 2000. The prince claimed in his 2019 interview that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2010, but this assertion was contradicted by a leaked email from 2011 in which the prince told Epstein, “we are in this together”. The civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in August 2021 alleged that she was forced to have sexual encounters with the prince in London, New York, and on Epstein’s private island, Little St James. The case was settled out of court in February 2022 for an undisclosed, multi-million-pound sum. While the exact figure was never officially disclosed, reports suggested the settlement could have been as high as £12 million. The settlement included a substantial donation to Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights. As part of the agreement, the prince acknowledged that Epstein “trafficked countless young girls over many years” and expressed regret for his association with the convicted sex offender. The source of the settlement funds became a matter of public debate. Reports suggested that the late Queen Elizabeth II may have contributed to the sum from her private Duchy of Lancaster estate, or that King Charles III may have provided a loan which the prince was expected to repay from the sale of his luxury ski chalet in Switzerland.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Final Push and Public Vindication</h2>
           <p>The immediate catalyst for the prince’s final withdrawal from his titles in October 2025 was the renewed public focus on the allegations. Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, had completed a memoir before her death. Excerpts from the forthcoming book, titled *Nobody’s Girl*, were published, detailing her alleged encounters with the prince. Giuffre wrote that the prince acted as if having sex with her was his “birthright”. The resurfacing of these claims, coupled with the earlier revelation of the 2011 email to Epstein, created a new and untenable public relations crisis for the monarchy. The decision to relinquish the titles was made after high-level meetings at Buckingham Palace, with the King and the Prince of Wales playing influential roles in the consultation. The move was widely welcomed by politicians and campaigners. In the city of York, which the prince’s title represented, the announcement was seen as a long-overdue victory. Rachael Maskell, the Labour Member of Parliament for York Central, had long called for the removal of the title, arguing that it carried an ambassadorial association that conflicted with the city’s status as England’s only UN Human Rights City. Maskell had previously proposed a Removal of Titles Bill to provide the King with the power to remove titles or to allow a joint parliamentary committee to recommend removal. Councillor Darryl Smalley, who led the successful 2022 campaign to strip the prince of the Honorary Freedom of York, welcomed the news, stating that the palace had finally recognised the prince as a “massive liability”. The family of Virginia Giuffre, including her brother Sky Roberts, released a statement calling the decision a “vindication” for her and for survivors of sex trafficking everywhere. Roberts noted that his late sister would have been “very proud”. However, the anti-monarchy group Republic dismissed the move as “too little, too late”, arguing that the prince should be stripped of all titles, including the one he holds by birth.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The agreement by Prince Andrew to cease using his titles and honours, including the Dukedom of York, represents the final, decisive step in his complete withdrawal from public royal life. While he remains a prince by birth and technically retains the peerage titles, the public commitment not to use them renders them politically and functionally inert. The decision, driven by the need to protect the monarchy from the continued distraction of the Epstein scandal, underscores the institution’s ultimate priority: self-preservation. The prince’s statement, which maintained his denial of all accusations, frames the action as a duty to his family and country. For the monarchy, the move closes a painful chapter that began with a disastrous television interview in 2019 and continued through a high-profile civil lawsuit and settlement in 2022. The focus now shifts to the constitutional question of whether Parliament will act to formally remove the dukedom and to the long-term implications of a non-working royal, who is still eighth in the line of succession, continuing to reside at the Royal Lodge in Windsor under a long-term lease.</p>
