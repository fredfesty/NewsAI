            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the high-stakes diplomatic meeting held at the White House on 29 September 2025, between United States President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The central focus of the summit was the negotiation of a new framework intended to terminate the protracted 2023-2025 war in the Gaza Strip, secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and establish a viable structure for the governance of post-war Gaza. This paper examines the historical antecedents of the conflict, tracing its origins from the late 19th century through to the series of escalations that have defined the Gaza-Israel relationship since the Israeli disengagement in 2005. It provides a detailed account of the 7 October 2023 attacks, which served as the catalyst for the ensuing war, and chronicles the major phases of the conflict, the attendant humanitarian crisis, and the preceding diplomatic efforts. The article further analyses the political and ideological dispositions of the two principal actors, Trump and Netanyahu, and the complex dynamics of their relationship. It deconstructs the reported components of the American peace proposal, including provisions for hostage release, post-war governance, security arrangements, and regional normalisation. The analysis extends to the respective positions and political constraints of the Israeli government, Hamas, and the Palestinian Authority. By situating the summit within its deep historical and immediate political context, this paper elucidates the profound challenges, strategic imperatives, and potential outcomes of a diplomatic initiative aimed at resolving one of the world's most intractable conflicts.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>On 29 September 2025, the White House became the focal point of intense international scrutiny as United States President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a meeting of critical significance <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. The summit, their fourth such encounter within the year, was convened with the expressed purpose of finalising a new, American-brokered framework to end the devastating war in the Gaza Strip, which began nearly two years prior <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. The discussions were aimed at addressing a triad of interconnected and formidable challenges: the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, the liberation of the remaining hostages captured during the initial attacks, and the establishment of a sustainable model for the governance of a post-war Gaza <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. President Trump, ahead of the talks, projected a characteristic sense of optimism, suggesting a "real chance for greatness" and expressing his determination to secure a definitive agreement <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The context for this high-stakes diplomacy is a Middle East profoundly altered by the war that erupted on 7 October 2023. The conflict, the longest and deadliest in the history of the Gaza-Israel confrontation, has resulted in unprecedented levels of destruction and loss of life, precipitating a humanitarian catastrophe within the besieged enclave <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. For Israel, the war was initiated with the declared objectives of dismantling the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and securing the return of all hostages <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. For the Palestinians in Gaza, it has been a period of immense suffering, displacement, and uncertainty. The international community, for its part, has been deeply divided, with mounting pressure on all parties to find a path towards a sustainable resolution.</p>

            <p>This article seeks to provide a scholarly and politically objective analysis of the September 2025 summit and the peace plan at its core. It will proceed by first establishing the deep historical context necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the contemporary situation. This involves an examination of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict's origins, the specific history of the Gaza Strip, the rise of Hamas, and the cycle of violence that preceded the 2023 war. Subsequently, the paper will detail the catalytic events of 7 October 2023 and the ensuing military conflict, charting its progression and devastating impact. An analysis of the two principal figures, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, will follow, exploring their political histories, ideological standpoints, and the nature of their past and present relationship. The core of the article will then be dedicated to a meticulous deconstruction of the proposed peace framework, examining its reported components concerning hostage release, post-war governance, security arrangements, and regional integration. The positions, pressures, and political dilemmas facing the Israeli government, Hamas, and the Palestinian Authority will be scrutinised to identify the primary obstacles and potential areas of convergence. The paper will conclude by synthesising these elements to assess the summit's potential implications for the future of the Gaza Strip and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

            <h2>Historical Background: The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict and the Gaza Strip</h2>

            <h3>The Genesis of a Conflict</h3>
            <p>The roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are deeply embedded in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the concurrent rise of two national movements, Zionism and Arab nationalism, laying claim to the same territory <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. The Zionist movement, which emerged in Europe, sought to establish a national homeland for the Jewish people in their ancestral Land of Israel, then a part of the Ottoman Empire known as Palestine <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. This aspiration gained significant political momentum with the issuance of the Balfour Declaration by the British government in 1917, which viewed with favour the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, Britain was granted a mandate to govern Palestine, a period marked by increasing Jewish immigration and escalating tensions with the resident Arab population <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The conflict intensified dramatically after World War II. In 1947, the United Nations adopted Resolution 181, a partition plan that recommended the division of Mandatory Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states, with Jerusalem under a special international regime <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan, but it was rejected by Arab leaders. On 14 May 1948, upon the termination of the British Mandate, the State of Israel declared its independence <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. This was immediately followed by the invasion of the nascent state by the armies of neighbouring Arab countries, initiating the 1948 Arab-Israeli War <sup><a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>. The war concluded in 1949 with armistice agreements that left Israel in control of more territory than allotted under the partition plan <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. The conflict resulted in the displacement of approximately 750,000 Palestinians, an event known in Arabic as the Nakba, or "catastrophe," creating a refugee crisis that remains central to the conflict to this day <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. The Gaza Strip was brought under Egyptian military administration, while the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, was controlled by Jordan <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>The 1967 War and the Occupation of Gaza</h3>
            <p>The geopolitical landscape was again transformed by the Six-Day War of June 1967. In a pre-emptive strike against Egypt and Syria, Israel achieved a swift and decisive victory, capturing the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. This marked the beginning of Israel's military occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal territory measuring approximately 365 square kilometres, was now under direct Israeli military rule. The occupation involved the establishment of Israeli settlements within the Strip, which were a source of constant friction with the local Palestinian population <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, passed in November 1967, called for the "withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict" and became a cornerstone for future peace negotiations <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of Hamas</h3>
            <p>During the first two decades of occupation, Palestinian resistance was largely led by the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). However, the outbreak of the First Intifada, a spontaneous popular uprising against Israeli rule that began in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza in December 1987, created a new political dynamic <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. It was in this context that Hamas (the Islamic Resistance Movement) was founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Hamas presented an Islamist alternative to the secular nationalism of the PLO. Its 1988 charter called for the liberation of all of historic Palestine and rejected a negotiated settlement with Israel <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. The organisation developed both a political wing and an armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and began to carry out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians.</p>

            <h3>The Oslo Accords and the Palestinian Authority</h3>
            <p>The early 1990s witnessed a significant diplomatic breakthrough with the signing of the Oslo Accords. A series of secret negotiations in Norway between Israel and the PLO culminated in the 1993 Declaration of Principles, signed in Washington, D.C. <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref43">43</a></sup>. The Accords established a framework for Palestinian self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a transitional five-year period, during which a permanent settlement was to be negotiated <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. This led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in 1994, to which Israel transferred certain civil and security responsibilities <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref45">45</a></sup>. Israeli forces withdrew from the main population centres of Gaza, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat returned from exile to establish the PA's headquarters in Gaza City <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. However, the Oslo process ultimately failed to achieve a final status agreement, collapsing after the failed Camp David Summit in 2000 and the outbreak of the more violent Second Intifada <sup><a href="#ref43">43</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Israel's 2005 Disengagement and the Hamas Takeover</h3>
            <p>In a move that reshaped the political landscape of the conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon implemented a unilateral disengagement plan in 2005 <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. The plan involved the dismantling of all 21 Israeli settlements in Gaza and the withdrawal of all Israeli soldiers and settlers from the territory <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. The evacuation was completed by 12 September 2005 <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. The stated rationale was to improve Israel's security and demographic situation in the absence of a negotiated peace <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. However, Israel retained control over Gaza's airspace, maritime access, and its land borders, with the exception of the Rafah crossing with Egypt <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref45">45</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The power vacuum left by the Israeli withdrawal was soon filled by Hamas. In the January 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Hamas won a surprise victory over the long-dominant Fatah party, a result attributed to popular frustration with Fatah's corruption and the moribund peace process <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. A tense national unity government was formed, but it quickly collapsed amid factional violence <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. In June 2007, after a brief but bloody conflict, Hamas fighters seized complete control of the Gaza Strip, expelling Fatah and PA forces <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. This event created a deep political schism, resulting in two separate Palestinian polities: a Hamas-governed Gaza Strip and a Fatah-led Palestinian Authority administering parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>The Blockade and the Cycle of Conflict</h3>
            <p>In response to the Hamas takeover, Israel, in coordination with Egypt, imposed a comprehensive land, air, and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip in 2007, citing the need to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas and other militant groups <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The blockade severely restricted the movement of people and goods, devastating Gaza's economy and leading to what many human rights organisations have described as a form of collective punishment and an "open-air prison" <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. The years following the takeover were characterised by a recurring cycle of conflict. Major wars erupted between Israel and Hamas in 2008-2009 (Operation Cast Lead), 2012 (Operation Pillar of Defense), 2014 (Operation Protective Edge), and 2021, interspersed with periods of fragile, often-violated ceasefires brokered by regional actors like Egypt and Qatar <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref47">47</a></sup>. Each round of fighting inflicted heavy casualties, predominantly on the Palestinian side, and caused widespread damage to Gaza's infrastructure, while Hamas and other groups continued to fire rockets into Israeli towns and cities <sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>. This was the volatile and unresolved context that preceded the unprecedented escalation of October 2023.</p>

            <h2>The Catalyst: The 2023-2025 Gaza War</h2>

            <h3>The 7 October 2023 Attacks</h3>
            <p>On the morning of 7 October 2023, a Jewish holiday, Hamas launched a complex and highly coordinated surprise attack on Israel, which it named "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood" <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The assault began with a massive barrage of thousands of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel, providing cover for an infiltration of approximately 3,000 militants who breached the fortified Gaza-Israel barrier by land, sea, and air <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. The attackers targeted more than 20 Israeli communities and military bases in the "Gaza envelope" region of southern Israel <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The ensuing violence was marked by extreme brutality, with militants perpetrating massacres in several kibbutzim and at the Nova music festival near Re'im <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. In total, the attacks resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 people in Israel, the majority of whom were civilians <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. Furthermore, around 251 individuals, including children, the elderly, and foreign nationals, were taken hostage and brought back into the Gaza Strip <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. Hamas stated that the attack was a response to the 16-year blockade, Israeli actions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and the broader occupation <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The scale and ferocity of the assault constituted a profound intelligence and security failure for Israel and represented the deadliest single day in the country's history <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Israel's Declaration of War and Military Campaign</h3>
            <p>In response to the attacks, the Israeli government formally declared war on Hamas and initiated a massive military operation named "Swords of Iron" <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The stated primary objectives were the complete destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities and the safe return of all hostages <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The campaign commenced with an intense aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, followed by a ground invasion that began on 27 October 2023 <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) progressively advanced through the territory, engaging in fierce urban combat with Hamas and other militant factions. The military campaign unfolded in several phases, beginning with operations in northern Gaza, including Gaza City, before expanding to central and southern areas such as Khan Yunis and, later, Rafah <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The conflict continued with varying intensity throughout 2024 and into 2025, evolving into a protracted war of attrition with Israeli forces conducting repeated operations in areas previously cleared, indicating the resilience of Hamas's guerrilla forces <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. By September 2025, Israeli forces were estimated to be in control of roughly 75% of the Gaza Strip <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>The Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza</h3>
            <p>The Israeli military campaign and the tightening of the pre-existing blockade precipitated a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale in the Gaza Strip. On 9 October 2023, Israel announced a "total blockade," cutting off the supply of food, water, fuel, and electricity <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. While some humanitarian aid was later permitted to enter through the Rafah crossing with Egypt and the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, the volume was consistently deemed insufficient by international aid organisations to meet the population's basic needs <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. The conflict resulted in a staggering number of Palestinian casualties. By September 2025, reports indicated that over 66,000 Palestinians in Gaza had been killed, with a significant proportion being women and children, and more than 168,000 injured <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The widespread Israeli bombardment caused immense destruction to residential buildings, hospitals, schools, and critical infrastructure, leading to the displacement of the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. The collapse of the healthcare system, coupled with severe shortages of food and clean water, led to the spread of disease and a severe hunger crisis, with international bodies warning of famine conditions <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Diplomatic Efforts and Ceasefires (2023-2025)</h3>
            <p>Throughout the conflict, numerous diplomatic efforts were undertaken to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages, with Qatar, Egypt, and the United States acting as the primary mediators <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. A temporary, week-long ceasefire was achieved in November 2023, which saw the release of 110 hostages held by Hamas in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners, mostly women and minors, held in Israeli jails <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. This truce also allowed for a temporary increase in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. However, the ceasefire broke down, and hostilities resumed on 1 December 2023 <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Subsequent negotiations proved exceedingly difficult, repeatedly stalling over fundamental disagreements. Hamas's core demands typically included a permanent end to the war, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile figures. Israel, conversely, insisted on the release of all hostages and the dismantling of Hamas, refusing to commit to a permanent ceasefire that would leave the group's leadership and military capabilities intact. A second, brief ceasefire reportedly took place from January to March 2025, but it too collapsed, with fighting resuming thereafter <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The protracted nature of the war and the immense human cost led to growing international pressure on both sides, particularly on Israel from its allies, to find a diplomatic resolution, setting the stage for the renewed American push in September 2025 <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>

            <h2>The Protagonists: Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu</h2>

            <h3>Benjamin Netanyahu: The Security-Focused Survivor</h3>
            <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's political career, spanning several decades and making him Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been defined by a staunchly security-centric worldview. A prominent figure in the right-wing Likud party, his political ideology is rooted in a deep-seated scepticism regarding the prospects for a lasting peace with the Palestinians and a firm belief in the necessity of maintaining overwhelming military strength. His approach to the conflict has consistently prioritised security control and risk management over territorial compromise for a two-state solution. Throughout his tenures, he has overseen the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and has often expressed doubts about the viability of a fully sovereign Palestinian state, which he views as a potential threat to Israel's security.</p>

            <p>By September 2025, Netanyahu's political position was exceptionally precarious. The 7 October attacks occurred under his watch, representing a catastrophic failure that shattered his long-cultivated image as "Mr. Security." Domestically, he faced immense pressure from multiple fronts: the families of the hostages demanding a deal for their release, a widespread anti-government protest movement calling for his resignation and new elections, and the far-right elements of his governing coalition who vehemently opposed any perceived concessions to Hamas and advocated for a continuation of the war until "total victory" was achieved <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. His public rejection of a role for the Palestinian Authority in post-war Gaza and his vow to "finish the job" against Hamas, expressed at the United Nations just prior to the Washington summit, underscored his difficult balancing act between placating his domestic base and responding to American pressure <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Donald Trump: The Transactional Dealmaker</h3>
            <p>Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy during his first presidential term (2017-2021) was characterised by a transactional, "America First" doctrine that often eschewed traditional diplomatic norms. In the Middle East, this manifested in a strong alignment with Israel and a departure from the long-standing American consensus on the peace process. His administration's key policies included the official recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the relocation of the U.S. embassy there, a move that broke with decades of international policy. His most celebrated regional achievement was the brokering of the Abraham Accords in 2020, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and several Arab nations—the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. These accords were significant in that they decoupled the issue of Arab-Israeli normalisation from the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a foundational principle of Arab diplomacy for decades <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Upon his hypothetical return to the presidency in January 2025, Trump inherited a Middle East in turmoil. The Gaza war presented a direct challenge to the stability fostered by the Abraham Accords and to his reputation as a master dealmaker <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. His relationship with Netanyahu, though historically close, had shown signs of strain. Trump had reportedly expressed frustration with Netanyahu's perceived reluctance to make peace and had issued warnings against actions such as the annexation of the West Bank <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. The September 2025 summit represented a critical test of his diplomatic approach in his second term. It was an opportunity to apply his transactional style to one of the world's most complex conflicts, leveraging American influence to forge an agreement where others had failed. His pre-meeting rhetoric, promising a "special" deal that "all are on board for," reflected his confidence in personal diplomacy and his desire to secure a major foreign policy victory <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

            <h2>The September 2025 Summit: Stakes, Proposals, and Challenges</h2>

            <h3>The American Peace Proposal</h3>
            <p>The summit on 29 September 2025 was convened to secure Israeli agreement for a comprehensive, multi-phased plan developed by the Trump administration following extensive consultations with Arab leaders on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. While Hamas claimed it had not formally received the proposal, its reported details, leaked through various media outlets, suggested a significant and structured effort to end the conflict <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>. The framework was reportedly built around a 21-point plan aimed at achieving both immediate de-escalation and long-term stability <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The first and most urgent phase of the plan stipulated the prompt release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, reportedly numbering 48, within a very short timeframe, possibly 48 hours after confirmation of the deal <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>. In exchange, Israel would be required to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including those serving life sentences for serious offences <sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>. This element of the proposal addressed the most pressing humanitarian and political issue for the Israeli public and government.</p>

            <p>The second major component of the plan addressed the future of Hamas and the governance of Gaza. It reportedly offered amnesty and safe passage out of Gaza for Hamas members who committed to peace, while stipulating that the group would have no future role in governing the territory and that all its military structures would be destroyed <sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>. This was designed to meet Israel's core demand of dismantling Hamas's capabilities. Crucially, the plan called for the establishment of an interim transitional government to administer Gaza. This body, referred to as the Gaza International Transitional Authority, would be composed of Palestinian technocrats and operate with the support of the United Nations and key Arab nations, particularly from the Gulf <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. This transitional authority would eventually be expected to hand over control to a reformed Palestinian Authority, a point of significant contention for Prime Minister Netanyahu <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The third element of the framework involved security and reconstruction. It outlined a gradual withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the Gaza Strip as the transitional government and a potential international stabilisation force assumed security responsibilities <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. The plan also envisioned a massive, internationally funded effort to reconstruct the devastated enclave, linking this to a broader regional integration strategy. This aspect was intended to provide a tangible "day after" vision, incentivising regional actors to invest in Gaza's stability and connecting the resolution of the conflict to the expansion of normalisation agreements, potentially including Saudi Arabia. One of the plan's more assertive points was that many of its governance and stabilisation aspects could proceed even without Hamas's formal agreement, contingent on Israel's cooperation <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Netanyahu's Political Conundrum</h3>
            <p>For Prime Minister Netanyahu, the American proposal presented a profound political dilemma. Accepting the deal would require him to halt the military offensive short of his declared goal of "total victory" over Hamas, a move that would be seen as a failure by his right-wing political base and, most critically, by the ultranationalist members of his governing coalition. Their departure would likely cause the collapse of his government, potentially ending his political career and exposing him to renewed legal jeopardy from his ongoing corruption trial. His public statements leading up to the meeting, including his firm rejection of a role for the PA in Gaza, were indicative of this pressure <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>However, rejecting the American plan carried its own significant risks. It would mean defying Israel's most important ally, potentially leading to a major diplomatic crisis with the Trump administration, which had invested considerable political capital in the proposal. Furthermore, it would mean forgoing what might be the last viable opportunity to secure the release of the remaining hostages, a deeply emotional issue for Israeli society. The families of the hostages had explicitly appealed to President Trump to stand firm and ensure the deal was implemented, adding to the domestic pressure on Netanyahu to accept <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. His position was therefore one of navigating between the irreconcilable demands of his political survival, the strategic imperative of maintaining the U.S. alliance, and the national responsibility to bring the hostages home.</p>

            <h3>The Positions of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority</h3>
            <p>While not present at the summit, the positions of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were central to its potential success or failure. For Hamas, any acceptable agreement would need to guarantee its survival. The group's primary demands throughout the war had been a permanent ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, conditions that would allow it to claim victory and potentially rebuild its power. The American proposal, with its call for the dismantling of Hamas's military structure and the exile of its leaders, was fundamentally at odds with the group's existential interests. Therefore, securing Hamas's compliance, particularly regarding the release of hostages without a guarantee of a permanent end to the war, remained the most significant obstacle.</p>

            <p>The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah and led by President Mahmoud Abbas, viewed the crisis with a mixture of concern and potential opportunity. Having been sidelined since its ousting from Gaza in 2007, the PA saw the American plan's provision for its eventual return to govern the Strip as a chance to restore Palestinian unity and regain relevance. However, the PA suffered from a severe lack of legitimacy among many Palestinians, who viewed it as corrupt, ineffective, and collaborationist with the Israeli occupation. For the PA to be a viable actor in a post-war scenario, it would require significant reform and a clear political horizon leading to statehood, elements that were contentious and not fully guaranteed within the reported framework. Netanyahu's explicit rejection of the PA's involvement further complicated its potential role, highlighting the deep-seated Israeli distrust that any post-war plan would have to overcome <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The White House meeting of 29 September 2025, between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu represented a critical inflection point in the Gaza war and the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was a moment where the transactional diplomacy of the Trump administration confronted the complex political realities and deep-seated historical grievances that have long defined the region. The American proposal was an ambitious attempt to thread a needle between Israel's security demands, the imperative of hostage release, the catastrophic humanitarian needs of Gaza, and the desire for a stable post-war order supported by regional Arab states.</p>

            <p>The success of this diplomatic gambit hinged on the ability to reconcile seemingly irreconcilable positions. It required a fundamental shift from Prime Minister Netanyahu, asking him to prioritise a negotiated settlement and the strategic relationship with the United States over the maximalist war aims demanded by his political coalition. It also faced the formidable challenge of securing the compliance of Hamas for a plan that envisioned its own dissolution. The outcomes of the summit, whether a breakthrough agreement, a partial understanding, or a diplomatic impasse, were poised to have profound and lasting consequences. They would not only determine the immediate future of the millions of people in Gaza and the fate of the remaining hostages but also shape the trajectory of regional stability and the ever-elusive prospect of a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
