            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In early October 2025, a multinational flotilla of civilian vessels, named the Global Sumud Flotilla, was intercepted in international waters by the Israeli Navy. The flotilla, carrying activists including Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg, aimed to breach the long-standing maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip and deliver symbolic humanitarian aid. The interception resulted in the detention of approximately 450 individuals from over 40 countries, who were subsequently transferred to Israeli prisons. In the days that followed, as the activists began to be deported, numerous and consistent allegations of mistreatment and abuse at the hands of Israeli authorities emerged. These claims, which include physical and psychological abuse, denial of adequate food, water, and medical care, and the singling out of prominent activists for humiliating treatment, have been met with strong denials from the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which labelled them "brazen lies". Conversely, Israel's National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, publicly stated he was "proud" of the harsh conditions imposed on the detainees, whom he referred to as "terror supporters". This incident has reignited international debate over the legality of the Gaza blockade, the conduct of the Israeli military, and the treatment of political detainees.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Mediterranean Sea, a cradle of civilisations and a vital artery of global trade, once again became the stage for a contentious international incident in early October 2025. The interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in international waters, and the subsequent detention and alleged mistreatment of its international crew and passengers, has brought the long-simmering issue of the Gaza blockade to the forefront of global attention. The flotilla, a coalition of more than 40 vessels carrying approximately 450 activists, parliamentarians, and journalists from over 40 nations, had a stated mission: to challenge the legality of the maritime blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip and to deliver a symbolic quantity of humanitarian aid to its beleaguered population  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref43">43</a></sup>. Among the participants was the high-profile Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, whose presence guaranteed significant media scrutiny  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. The Israeli government, viewing the flotilla as a provocation and a potential security threat, was resolute in its determination to prevent it from reaching its destination. The ensuing events, from the military operation on the high seas to the experiences of the activists in Israeli detention, have generated a firestorm of controversy, replete with allegations of abuse, competing narratives, and complex questions of international law.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Enduring Blockade of the Gaza Strip</h3>
            <p>To comprehend the context of the Global Sumud Flotilla, it is essential to understand the history and legal debate surrounding the blockade of the Gaza Strip. Israel, citing security concerns, particularly the prevention of weapons smuggling to Hamas and other militant groups, intensified its control over Gaza's borders after Hamas took political control of the territory in 2007  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. This control extends to Gaza's airspace, its land crossings, and its territorial waters, effectively creating what many critics have described as the world's largest open-air prison  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. The blockade encompasses severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods, a policy that has had a devastating impact on the economy and the daily lives of Gaza's more than two million residents  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The legality of this maritime blockade is a subject of intense and polarised debate within the realm of international law. The Israeli government and its supporters maintain that the blockade is a legitimate act of self-defence, permissible under the laws of armed conflict  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. They point to the ongoing state of conflict with Hamas and argue that a naval blockade is a lawful tool to prevent the entry of weapons into an enemy's territory. This position was notably supported by the 2011 United Nations Palmer Report, which investigated the 2010 Mavi Marmara flotilla incident. The report concluded that Israel "faces a real threat to its security from militant groups in Gaza" and that the "naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure"  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. The report further argued that the blockade was not a form of collective punishment as its primary purpose was security, and that its implementation complied with the requirements of international law, such as being declared and notified  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Conversely, a significant body of international legal opinion, including numerous United Nations experts, human rights organisations, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), holds that the blockade is illegal  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. The central argument against its legality is that it constitutes a form of collective punishment against the entire civilian population of Gaza for the actions of its ruling authorities, a practice strictly prohibited under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention  <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. Critics argue that the blockade's impact is disproportionately borne by civilians, leading to widespread unemployment, poverty, and a severe humanitarian crisis, and that it infringes upon the fundamental human rights of the Gazan people  <sup><a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. A group of UN independent experts, responding to the Palmer Report, stated that it "does not recognize the naval blockade as an integral part of Israel's closure policy towards Gaza which has a disproportionate impact on the human rights of civilians"  <sup><a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. Furthermore, some legal scholars contend that as Israel remains the occupying power in Gaza due to its effective control over the territory's borders, it is precluded under international humanitarian law from imposing a blockade on the population it occupies  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. This ongoing legal schism forms the backdrop against which the actions of both the flotilla organisers and the Israeli state must be viewed.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>A History of Confrontation at Sea</h3>
            <p>The Global Sumud Flotilla was not the first attempt by international activists to challenge the Gaza blockade by sea. It follows a long line of similar missions organised by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and other groups, each with its own dramatic and often tragic outcome  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. The first successful breach of the blockade occurred in August 2008, when two small boats from the Free Gaza Movement reached the territory  <sup><a href="#ref39">39</a>, <a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. However, subsequent attempts have been consistently intercepted by the Israeli navy  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The most infamous of these was the May 2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla, which included the Turkish passenger ship, the Mavi Marmara  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. When Israeli commandos boarded the vessel in international waters, they were met with resistance from some of the activists on board. In the ensuing clashes, nine activists were killed by Israeli forces, with a tenth dying years later from his injuries  <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>. The incident sparked a major international crisis, severely damaging relations between Israel and Turkey and leading to widespread condemnation  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. A UN Human Rights Council fact-finding mission found that the Israeli raid involved "unnecessary and incredible violence" and that there was "clear evidence to support prosecutions" for wilful killing and torture  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. While the subsequent Palmer Report found the blockade itself to be legal, it deemed the force used by Israeli soldiers to be "excessive and unreasonable"  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Other flotillas followed in 2011, 2015, and 2018, all of which were intercepted without the same level of violence but resulted in the detention and deportation of the participants  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. In 2025 alone, prior to the Global Sumud Flotilla, several smaller missions were launched. In May, a vessel named 'Conscience' was struck by explosives from a drone in international waters near Malta, an act the Freedom Flotilla Coalition described as a "deliberate act of aggression and intimidation"  <sup><a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>. In June and July, the vessels 'Madleen' and 'Handala' were also intercepted by the Israeli navy in international waters  <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. This history of repeated confrontations underscores the high stakes and the deeply entrenched positions of both sides, setting a predictable, yet perilous, course for the Global Sumud Flotilla.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Voyage and Interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla</h3>
            <p>The Global Sumud Flotilla, the largest such convoy in history, was a coordinated effort involving several activist groups  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. Comprising over 40 vessels, it carried around 450 participants from more than 44 countries, including parliamentarians, lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref43">43</a></sup>. The flotilla's stated aim was not only to deliver symbolic aid, such as a single can of baby formula noted by Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, but more significantly, to challenge the legality of the blockade and establish a maritime corridor to Gaza  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The Israeli government made its intentions clear long before the flotilla approached the coast. Officials issued warnings and engaged in what Amnesty International described as "weeks of threats and incitement" against the mission and its participants  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. The Israeli Foreign Ministry warned the final vessel, the Marinette, that its "attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented".</p>
            <p>Between Wednesday, 1st October, and Friday, 3rd October 2025, the Israeli Navy systematically intercepted all the vessels of the flotilla  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The interceptions took place in international waters, with the final boat, the Polish-flagged Marinette, being boarded approximately 42.5 nautical miles from the Gaza coast  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. The Israeli military operation involved naval forces boarding the boats, cutting communications, and detaining all those on board  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. The activists were then transported to the Israeli port of Ashdod. Upon arrival, they were processed by immigration authorities and subsequently transferred to detention facilities, primarily the Ketziot prison in the Negev desert, a high-security facility used to hold Palestinian security prisoners  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Allegations of Abuse and Mistreatment in Detention</h3>
            <p>In the days following the interception, as the first groups of activists were deported, a torrent of allegations regarding their treatment in Israeli custody began to surface. Deported activists arriving in cities like Rome, Istanbul, and Geneva gave remarkably consistent accounts of what they described as abusive and humiliating treatment by Israeli soldiers and prison guards  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>A primary and recurring complaint was the denial of basic necessities. Numerous detainees reported being deprived of adequate food and water for extended periods, sometimes for days  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. Malaysian activist Heliza Helmi stated that for three days she only drank water from a toilet  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The legal aid organisation Adalah, which represented many of the detainees, reported that the provision of food and water was "grossly inadequate"  <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. There were also widespread claims that essential medicines were confiscated and withheld from those with pre-existing medical conditions, including heart disease and asthma  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Beyond neglect, activists detailed acts of physical and psychological abuse. Italian journalist Lorenzo D'Agostino described being intimidated with dogs and having the laser sights of guns pointed at prisoners "to scare us"  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. Another Italian activist, Paolo De Montis, spoke of "constant stress and humiliation," including being forced to keep his head down and being slapped on the back of the head when he looked up  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. Australian activist Surya McEwen alleged that his arm was dislocated and his head was slammed into the ground by Israeli forces  <sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>. Many activists reported being forced to kneel for hours with their hands bound by zip ties  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. Adalah's lawyers also collected testimonies of physical violence, with some detainees reporting being blindfolded and handcuffed for prolonged periods  <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The treatment of Swedish activist Greta Thunberg became a particular focus of the allegations. According to an email from the Swedish foreign ministry, based on a visit with her in prison, Thunberg reported suffering from dehydration due to insufficient food and water, and had developed rashes she suspected were caused by bedbugs in her cell  <sup><a href="#ref45">45</a></sup>. She also spoke of "harsh treatment" and being made to sit for long periods on hard surfaces  <sup><a href="#ref45">45</a></sup>. Other deported activists provided even more disturbing accounts. Turkish journalist Ersin Çelik alleged that he witnessed Israeli forces drag Thunberg by her hair, beat her, and force her to kiss an Israeli flag  <sup><a href="#ref45">45</a></sup>. American participant Windfield Beaver and Malaysian activist Hazwani Helmi gave similar accounts, stating that Thunberg was shoved, paraded with an Israeli flag, and "used as propaganda"  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. Italian journalist Saverio Tommasi said he saw Thunberg at the port with her arms tied and an Israeli flag placed next to her as a form of "mockery"  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Official Israeli Responses and International Reactions</h3>
            <p>The Israeli government's response to these allegations has been twofold and contradictory. The Israeli Foreign Ministry has vehemently denied all claims of mistreatment, dismissing them as "brazen lies" and "ludicrous and baseless allegations"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. In a statement on the social media platform X, the ministry insisted that "all the detainees' legal rights are fully upheld" and that Thunberg herself had not complained to Israeli authorities about the alleged incidents "because they never occurred"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. The ministry also claimed that some activists, including Thunberg, had deliberately prolonged their detention by refusing to sign documents that would have expedited their deportation  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>In stark contrast to the Foreign Ministry's denials, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a prominent far-right figure in the Israeli government, publicly celebrated the harsh treatment of the activists. After visiting Ketziot prison, he stated he was "proud that we treat the 'flotilla activists' as terror supporters"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. He added, "Anyone who supports terrorism is a terrorist and deserves the conditions of terrorists... They should get a good feel for the conditions in Ketziot prison and think twice before they approach Israel again"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. Ben-Gvir was also filmed at Ashdod port, taunting the detained activists and calling them "terrorists"  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. This divergence in official statements highlights deep divisions within the Israeli government and presents a confusing and conflicting official narrative.</p>
            <p>The interception of the flotilla and the subsequent allegations prompted a wave of international condemnation. The government of South Africa called the interception a "grave offence" and a "violation of international law," demanding the immediate release of the detainees  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. Pakistan's government strongly condemned the action as a "flagrant violation of international law" and part of Israel's "ongoing pattern of aggression"  <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. The Maldives also issued a statement condemning the "unlawful interception" as a "blatant violation of international law"  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. Greece issued a "strong written protest" to Israel, believed to be in response to the behaviour of Minister Ben-Gvir  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Human rights organisations were unequivocal in their criticism. Amnesty International's Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, described the interception as a "brazen assault against solidarity activists carrying out an entirely peaceful humanitarian mission" and a "calculated act of intimidation intended to punish and silence critics"  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. The organisation called for the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. Human Rights Watch, which has previously criticised Israel's blockade of Gaza as a form of collective punishment, also condemned the interception  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Deportations and the Aftermath</h3>
            <p>Beginning on Saturday, 4th October 2025, Israeli authorities began deporting the flotilla participants. The first group of 137 activists was flown to Istanbul, Turkey  <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. Over the following days, more groups were deported, with many, including Greta Thunberg, being flown to Athens, Greece, from where they could catch connecting flights to their home countries  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. The deportations continued into the week, with dozens of French, Greek, Italian, and Swedish nationals among those released  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>For the activists, the journey home was an opportunity to share their experiences with the world's media, ensuring that their allegations of mistreatment received widespread coverage. For the Israeli government, the deportations were a way to manage the fallout from the incident, though the conflicting official statements and the graphic testimonies of the activists have done little to quell the international criticism. The interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla has once again highlighted the intractable nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the profound human cost of the Gaza blockade. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the legal, political, and moral complexities that define this enduring conflict, where the waters of the Mediterranean continue to be a flashpoint for confrontation and a symbol of a deeply divided world.</p>
