            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In the autumn of 2025, the French justice system is once again compelled to confront the harrowing case of Gisèle Pelicot. An appeal trial, initiated by one of the fifty men convicted of her rape, reopens a legal and societal wound that has yet to heal. This case, which first came to public attention with a trial of unprecedented scale in 2024, exposed a decade of systematic, drug-facilitated sexual abuse orchestrated by her husband, Dominique Pelicot. Gisèle Pelicot’s decision to waive her anonymity transformed a personal tragedy into a national reckoning with issues of consent, chemical submission, and the pervasive culture of sexual violence. The appeal by Husamettin Dogan, who maintains he was manipulated and is not a rapist, ensures that the questions raised by this affair remain at the forefront of public discourse. This examination delves into the intricate history of the case, the profound legal and social shifts it has catalysed, and the enduring resolve of a woman who has become an unwitting icon for survivors of sexual violence worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The judicial saga surrounding Gisèle Pelicot, a case that has irrevocably marked the French collective consciousness, enters a new chapter on the 6th of October 2025  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. In the city of Nîmes, the court of appeal will re-examine the conviction of Husamettin Dogan, one of the fifty-one men found guilty in the 2024 trial for the repeated rapes of Madame Pelicot  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. This appeal ensures that the harrowing details of a decade of abuse, orchestrated by her then-husband Dominique Pelicot, will once again be scrutinised in a public forum. The original trial, held in Avignon, was a landmark event, not only for its scale but for the courageous decision of the victim to waive her right to anonymity, a move that transformed her into a global symbol of resistance against sexual violence  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Gisèle Pelicot’s steadfast presence in the face of her abusers, and her declaration that shame should belong to the perpetrators, not the victims, ignited a profound societal debate in France and beyond  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The initial trial concluded in December 2024 with the conviction of all fifty-one defendants  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Dominique Pelicot, the architect of the abuse, received the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison for aggravated rape and a litany of other charges  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The other men, who were recruited online by Dominique Pelicot to assault his wife while she was unconscious under the influence of powerful sedatives, received sentences ranging from three to fifteen years  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. While seventeen of the convicted men initially lodged appeals, all but one, Husamettin Dogan, have since withdrawn them  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Dogan, who was sentenced to nine years in prison, maintains his innocence, arguing that he was misled by Dominique Pelicot into believing the acts were part of a consensual libertine arrangement  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. His appeal necessitates a new trial, where the evidence will be re-examined, and Gisèle Pelicot, once again, will face one of her aggressors in court, this time as a witness  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This appeal trial is not merely a legal formality; it is a continuation of a national conversation that the Pelicot case has forced upon France. It has thrown into sharp relief the inadequacies of French law concerning sexual consent, which, at the time of the initial trial, did not explicitly define rape by the absence of consent but rather by the presence of violence, coercion, threat, or surprise  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The case has also brought the phenomenon of ‘soumission chimique’, or drug-facilitated sexual assault, out of the shadows and into the public and political spotlight, prompting calls for legal and medical reforms  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. The enduring impact of Gisèle Pelicot’s testimony, her quiet dignity, and her unwavering resolve have galvanised feminist movements and prompted a re-evaluation of societal attitudes towards victims of sexual violence  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. The proceedings in Nîmes, therefore, will be closely watched, not just for their legal outcome, but for what they signify about the evolution of French society in the wake of a case that has exposed its deepest-seated pathologies regarding gender, power, and justice.</p>

            <h3>The Unveiling of a Decade of Deception</h3>
            <p>The horrifying reality of Gisèle Pelicot’s life between 2011 and 2020 was a secret she herself did not keep, for it was a secret that was kept from her. For nearly a decade, her husband, Dominique Pelicot, a man she had been married to for almost fifty years and with whom she had three children, systematically drugged her and invited other men to rape her while she was unconscious  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. The abuse took place primarily in their home in Mazan, a quiet town in the Vaucluse department of southeastern France, a place they had moved to for their retirement  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. Gisèle Pelicot experienced perplexing health problems during this period, including memory lapses, blackouts, and hair loss, which she and her doctors attributed to the potential onset of a serious illness like Alzheimer's or a brain tumour  <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. Her husband, the perpetrator of her suffering, accompanied her to medical appointments, feigning concern and support  <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The discovery of this prolonged abuse was entirely fortuitous. In September 2020, Dominique Pelicot was arrested for taking upskirt photographs of women in a local supermarket  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. A subsequent police search of his computer equipment uncovered a meticulously organised archive of over 20,000 images and videos  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. This digital library documented the rapes of his wife by himself and dozens of other men  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. It was only then, when confronted with this irrefutable evidence by investigators on the 2nd of November 2020, that Gisèle Pelicot learned of the decade of violation she had endured  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. The men who participated in these assaults were recruited by Dominique Pelicot through online chat forums, with some evidence suggesting the use of a forum titled "without her knowledge"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. The police were able to identify and bring to trial fifty of these men, though it is believed that the total number of assailants was higher, with some remaining unidentified  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The investigation revealed the chilling methodology of Dominique Pelicot. He would crush sedatives, such as the anxiolytic Temesta (lorazepam), and mix them into his wife's food and drink  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. He experimented with dosages to ensure she would remain in a deep, unresponsive state for extended periods  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>. He then filmed the assaults, which he orchestrated with the men he had invited into their home  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. The videos served as the primary evidence in the subsequent trial, leaving no doubt as to the unconscious state of Gisèle Pelicot and the identities of her assailants  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. The defendants came from a wide range of backgrounds and ages, from their twenties to their seventies, and included a nurse, a journalist, a soldier, and a prison warden, leading them to be described in the French media as "Monsieur Tout-le-Monde" or "Mr. Everyman"  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. This cross-section of society participating in such heinous acts added another layer of shock and horror to the case, challenging any simplistic notions of who a rapist might be  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>The Avignon Trial: A Nation Transfixed</h3>
            <p>The trial of Dominique Pelicot and the fifty other men began on the 2nd of September 2024, at the courthouse in Avignon  <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. From its inception, the case garnered immense national and international media attention, not least because of Gisèle Pelicot’s decision to waive her right to anonymity and for the trial to be held in public  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. This act of profound courage was a deliberate choice to shift the narrative of shame from the victim to the perpetrators  <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>. As she stated, "I want all women who have been raped to say: Madame Pelicot did it, I can too. I don't want them to be ashamed any longer"  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. This sentiment resonated deeply with the public, and she was met with daily shows of support from crowds gathered outside the courthouse  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The trial, which lasted for over three months, laid bare the horrific details of the abuse. The court was shown videos of the rapes, evidence that Gisèle Pelicot insisted be presented publicly, challenging an initial judicial decision for them to be viewed behind closed doors  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. Her testimony was a focal point of the proceedings. With remarkable composure, she recounted the discovery of her husband's betrayal and the devastating impact it had on her life and her sense of self  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. She confronted the defendants directly, challenging their claims of ignorance and complicity  <sup><a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. Dominique Pelicot confessed to the charges against him, stating in court, "I am a rapist, like the others in this room"  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. However, the majority of the other defendants denied the charge of rape, offering a range of justifications for their actions  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. Some claimed they believed they were participating in a consensual libertine scenario, and that Dominique Pelicot's consent was sufficient  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. Others argued they were manipulated or did not realise the extent of Gisèle Pelicot's incapacitation  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. One defendant even testified that he had learned the meaning of consent only while in prison awaiting trial  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The defence strategies employed by some of the accused and their lawyers were heavily criticised for resorting to victim-blaming tactics, questioning Gisèle Pelicot's lifestyle and her demeanour in court  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. These arguments, however, were largely undermined by the video evidence, which clearly depicted an unconscious and unresponsive victim  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. The prosecution argued forcefully that the absence of consent was unequivocal and that each man who entered that bedroom and participated in the assaults was a rapist  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. The trial became a platform for a much broader discussion about the nature of consent in French law and society. The public prosecutor, Laure Chabaud, asserted that "it is not possible any more, in 2024, to consider that, because she hasn't said anything, [a woman] is consenting"  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>On the 19th of December 2024, the verdicts were delivered. All fifty-one men were found guilty  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to the maximum term of twenty years in prison  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. The other defendants received sentences ranging from three to fifteen years, with two sentences being suspended  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. While the guilty verdicts were widely welcomed, there was some public disappointment and anger at the perceived leniency of some of the sentences for the co-accused, which were lower than what the prosecution had requested  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. In a statement following the verdict, Gisèle Pelicot expressed her gratitude for the support she had received and her hope for a future of mutual respect between men and women  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. The trial, in its exposure of the darkest aspects of human behaviour, had also showcased the extraordinary resilience of the human spirit.</p>

            <h3>The Appeal of Husamettin Dogan: A Final Confrontation</h3>
            <p>In the aftermath of the landmark Avignon trial, the legal process was not entirely concluded. While Dominique Pelicot chose not to appeal his twenty-year sentence, stating a desire to spare his ex-wife a further ordeal, seventeen of his co-defendants initially decided to challenge their convictions  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>. Over the ensuing months, sixteen of them withdrew their appeals, leaving Husamettin Dogan as the sole appellant  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Dogan, a 44-year-old construction worker, was sentenced to nine years in prison for the rape of Gisèle Pelicot  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. His insistence on proceeding with an appeal means that the case will be retried before the Court of Assizes of the Gard in Nîmes, this time before a jury of nine citizens and three professional magistrates, unlike the first trial which was heard only by professional judges  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The grounds for Husamettin Dogan's appeal centre on his assertion that he is not a rapist and that he was deceived by Dominique Pelicot  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. His lawyer, Jean-Marc Darrigade, has stated that his client maintains he "never went to the couple's home with the intention of raping anyone" and that he was led to believe he was participating in a consensual "libertine plan" where Gisèle Pelicot would be pretending to be asleep  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. During the initial trial, Dogan testified that he had met Dominique Pelicot online and was invited to their home in June 2019  <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. He admitted to finding Gisèle Pelicot unconscious on the bed and, after being reassured by her husband that she was alive, he proceeded to rape her  <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. He claimed to have left in a hurry when he heard her snoring, believing she was about to wake up  <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. Despite admitting the act, he has consistently rejected the legal and moral classification of his actions as rape, a label he has described as "too heavy for me to bear"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Gisèle Pelicot has confirmed that she will be present at the appeal trial in Nîmes, which is expected to last for four days  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. Her lawyer, Antoine Camus, has stated that while she would have preferred to move on with her life, she feels a responsibility to see the legal process through to its conclusion  <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. Her presence is seen as crucial to ensuring that the court fully comprehends the gravity of the crime. As her lawyer articulated, "She will be there to explain that a rape is a rape, that there is no such thing as a small rape"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. Dominique Pelicot is also expected to be brought from prison to testify as a witness during the appeal trial  <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>. His testimony from the first trial, where he implicated all the other men as willing participants, will likely be a key element of the proceedings  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The appeal trial of Husamettin Dogan is fraught with legal and symbolic significance. For Dogan, it is a final attempt to clear his name of a conviction he vehemently contests. For Gisèle Pelicot, it is another painful but necessary step in her quest for justice. For the French public, it is a reminder that the societal conversation sparked by this case is far from over. The outcome of this appeal will be scrutinised for its legal reasoning and for the message it sends about accountability and the understanding of consent in the French justice system. The presence of a citizen jury introduces a new dynamic, and their verdict will be seen as a reflection of the evolution of public opinion in the wake of the "Pelicot effect".</p>

            <h3>The Pelicot Effect: A Catalyst for Legal and Social Change</h3>
            <p>The Gisèle Pelicot case has had a profound and far-reaching impact on French society, extending well beyond the confines of the courtroom. It has served as a powerful catalyst for a national conversation on sexual violence, consent, and the legal framework that governs them. One of the most significant consequences of the trial has been the renewed and intensified debate surrounding the legal definition of rape in France  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. At the time of the trial, the French penal code defined rape as an act of sexual penetration committed through "violence, coercion, threat or surprise," with no explicit mention of the absence of consent  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. This legal formulation has long been criticised by feminist organisations for placing the burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that they resisted, rather than on the accused to prove that they had obtained consent.</p>
            <p>The Pelicot case, where the victim was unconscious and therefore incapable of either consenting or resisting, starkly highlighted the limitations of this definition  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The defence arguments of some of the accused, who claimed they believed they had the husband's consent, further exposed the dangerous ambiguities in a legal framework that does not centre on the explicit consent of the individual  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. In the wake of the trial, there has been a significant political and public push to amend the law. A parliamentary report published in January 2025 recommended updating the penal code to include a clear reference to consent  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. Prominent political figures, including President Emmanuel Macron and the Minister of Justice, have expressed their support for such a reform  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The case has given momentum to the argument for an "only yes means yes" model of consent, similar to that adopted by other European countries  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Beyond the specific issue of consent, the trial has also cast a much-needed spotlight on the phenomenon of drug-facilitated sexual assault, or "chemical submission"  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. Gisèle Pelicot's decade-long ordeal, during which she was unknowingly drugged by her husband, has raised public and professional awareness of this insidious form of abuse  <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. Her daughter, Caroline Darian, has become a prominent advocate on this issue, launching a campaign to raise awareness and improve support for victims  <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The French government has responded by announcing reforms, including the provision of state-funded testing kits for suspected victims of drugging and measures to make it easier for victims to file complaints at hospitals  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. The case has underscored the need for better training for medical professionals to recognise the signs of chemical submission, as Gisèle Pelicot's own doctors had failed to identify the cause of her mysterious symptoms for years  <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most profound impact of the case, however, has been cultural. Gisèle Pelicot, through her quiet dignity, her unwavering resolve, and her refusal to be shamed into silence, has become a feminist icon in France and internationally  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. She has fundamentally shifted the public discourse on sexual violence, embodying the principle that the shame of rape belongs to the perpetrator, not the victim  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. Her courage has inspired countless other survivors to speak out and has galvanised a new wave of feminist activism  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. The widespread public support she received throughout the trial, and the global media attention the case has attracted, are indicative of a societal shift in attitudes towards sexual violence. The "Pelicot effect" is not just about legal reform; it is about a collective refusal to look away from the reality of male violence and a demand for a society where such atrocities are no longer tolerated or excused.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The appeal trial of Husamettin Dogan in Nîmes represents more than just the final legal chapter of a single criminal case; it is a poignant epilogue to a story that has forced a nation to confront uncomfortable truths about itself. The Gisèle Pelicot affair, in all its horrifying detail, has transcended the realm of a mere news item to become a cultural and judicial touchstone. It has laid bare the insidious nature of coercive control, the terrifying reality of drug-facilitated sexual assault, and the deeply entrenched societal attitudes that can enable and obscure male violence. The initial trial in Avignon was a moment of collective shock and reckoning, but the enduring legacy of this case will be measured by the lasting changes it inspires.</p>
            <p>The legal reforms concerning the definition of consent and the response to chemical submission, which have gained significant momentum in the wake of the trial, are crucial steps towards a more just and protective legal framework for victims of sexual violence. However, the most profound transformation catalysed by this case may be the cultural one. Gisèle Pelicot’s courageous decision to speak her name and tell her story in a public forum has had an immeasurable impact. She has not only given a voice to the countless victims who have suffered in silence but has also fundamentally challenged the culture of shame that has for so long been a weapon of perpetrators. Her quiet strength and unwavering dignity have provided a powerful counter-narrative to the victim-blaming tropes that have often dominated discussions of sexual assault.</p>
            <p>As the court in Nîmes convenes to hear the appeal of one of the fifty-one convicted men, the world will once again be reminded of the decade of abuse that Gisèle Pelicot endured. But it will also be reminded of her extraordinary resilience. The legal outcome of this final trial is, of course, of great importance for the individuals involved. Yet, in a broader sense, the verdict has already been delivered by a society that has been irrevocably changed by this case. The name Gisèle Pelicot is now synonymous not with victimhood, but with the power of truth, the courage to confront injustice, and the unyielding demand for a world where no one has to endure what she did. The trial may be drawing to a close, but the conversation it started has only just begun.</p>
