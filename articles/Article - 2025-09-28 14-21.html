            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article examines Prime Minister Keir Starmer's keynote speech at the Labour Party conference held in Liverpool from 21 to 25 September 2024, with a particular focus on his pointed criticisms of Reform UK's immigration policies. Starmer characterised elements of Reform's approach as divisive and rooted in populist rhetoric, implicitly linking them to broader concerns over racism and far-right influences in British politics. The analysis situates this speech within the context of Labour's recent electoral victory, ongoing internal party tensions, and international alliances such as AUKUS. Drawing on contemporary political discourse, polling data, and historical precedents, the article explores the implications for UK immigration policy, party leadership dynamics, and the fight against populism. It provides a comprehensive background on the evolution of immigration debates in the UK, Labour's policy framework, and Reform UK's rise, ensuring accessibility for readers unfamiliar with these topics. The discussion remains politically neutral, emphasising factual analysis over partisan interpretation.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Labour Party conference in Liverpool, spanning 21 to 25 September 2024, served as a pivotal moment for the newly elected government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Just two months after securing a landslide victory in the general election on 4 July 2024, Labour faced the dual task of consolidating its mandate and addressing mounting domestic challenges <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. Starmer's closing speech on 25 September 2024 was a cornerstone of the event, blending optimism about economic renewal with stern warnings against the resurgence of populist politics, particularly from Reform UK. In this address, Starmer directly challenged Reform UK's immigration proposals, describing them as not only impractical but also perilously divisive, with undertones that echoed accusations of racism in public discourse <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>To understand the significance of these remarks, it is essential to contextualise them within the broader landscape of British politics. Immigration has long been a flashpoint in UK public life, influencing electoral outcomes and policy directions since the post-war era. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, emerged as a disruptive force in the 2024 election, capitalising on dissatisfaction with mainstream parties' handling of migration, the economy, and cultural changes. Starmer's critique was not merely rhetorical; it reflected Labour's strategic positioning to reclaim the centre ground while countering perceptions of weakness on border control <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>This article delves into the content and reception of Starmer's speech, providing background on the historical and contemporary dimensions of UK immigration policy. It examines the interplay between domestic politics and international relations, including discussions on the AUKUS pact with Australia. Internal Labour dynamics, evidenced by polling indicating doubts over Starmer's leadership, are also analysed. The narrative is structured to elucidate complex political phenomena for readers without prior expertise, employing precise terminology while avoiding jargon where possible. All assertions are supported by verifiable sources, ensuring scholarly rigour.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The roots of contemporary UK immigration debates trace back to the mid-20th century, when post-World War II reconstruction necessitated labour inflows from Commonwealth nations. The British Nationality Act 1948 granted citizenship rights to subjects of the Crown, facilitating migration from the Caribbean, South Asia, and Africa <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. This period, often romanticised as one of multicultural foundation-building, was marred by tensions, exemplified by events such as the 1958 Notting Hill race riots, which highlighted racial prejudices embedded in British society <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Subsequent decades saw legislative efforts to manage inflows. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and 1968 restricted entry, signalling a shift towards controlled migration amid rising public anxieties <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The 1971 Immigration Act further delineated categories of entrants, distinguishing between those with right of abode and others requiring visas. These measures were responses to economic pressures and political rhetoric, with Enoch Powell's 1968 "Rivers of Blood" speech epitomising the inflammatory discourse that equated immigration with cultural erosion <sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The late 1990s and 2000s under New Labour, led by Tony Blair, marked a liberalising phase. The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights, influencing asylum policies, while EU enlargement in 2004 prompted unrestricted access for Eastern European workers <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. Net migration surged, peaking at over 700,000 in 2022, driven by non-EU students, healthcare workers, and humanitarian routes <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. This era fostered economic growth but also fuelled Euroscepticism, culminating in the 2016 Brexit referendum, where immigration control was a central pledge <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Post-Brexit, the Conservative governments of 2019-2024 implemented the points-based system in 2021, aiming to prioritise skilled workers while curbing low-skilled entry <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. However, irregular crossings via the English Channel escalated, with over 45,000 arrivals in 2022 alone, prompting the controversial Rwanda deportation scheme <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. Public opinion polls consistently ranked immigration among top concerns, with 52% of voters in 2024 citing it as a priority <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Enter Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party, which rebranded in 2021 under Farage's leadership. The party advocates stringent measures, including a migration cap, exit from the European Convention on Human Rights, and offshore processing <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. In the 2024 election, Reform secured 14.3% of the vote and five seats, outperforming expectations and fragmenting the right-wing vote <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. Critics, including Labour figures, have accused Reform of dog-whistle politics, where anti-immigrant rhetoric veils xenophobic undertones <sup><a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Labour's 2024 manifesto promised to "smash the gangs" behind Channel crossings, recruit 8,500 border force officers, and clear asylum backlogs, while maintaining the points-based system <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. Starmer's government, upon taking office, scrapped the Rwanda plan, redirecting resources to enforcement and international agreements <sup><a href="#ref18">18</a></sup>. This backdrop framed the 2024 conference, where Starmer sought to assert Labour's credibility on immigration amid Reform's rising poll numbers, hovering around 20% in late 2024 <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The conference itself occurred against a turbulent domestic scene. Labour's early decisions, such as means-testing winter fuel payments, sparked backlash, with membership dissatisfaction evident in internal ballots <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. A September 2024 poll by YouGov revealed that only 45% of Labour voters believed Starmer should lead into the next election, reflecting concerns over economic delivery <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. Internationally, Starmer's speech touched on alliances like AUKUS, a 2021 trilateral security pact with the US and Australia, focused on Indo-Pacific stability and nuclear submarine technology <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. Discussions with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese underscored transatlantic solidarity, with Albanese publicly supporting Starmer amid UK party strife <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Starmer's Speech: Key Themes and Critiques of Reform UK</h2>
            <p>Keir Starmer's 25 September 2024 address lasted approximately 75 minutes, delivered to a packed auditorium in Liverpool's ACC Centre. The speech opened with tributes to Labour's historic win, attributing it to a rejection of 14 years of Conservative rule marked by austerity, Brexit fallout, and scandal <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. Starmer outlined a "mission-driven" government agenda, emphasising growth, clean energy, and NHS reform <sup><a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>A significant portion addressed immigration, where Starmer positioned Labour as pragmatic reformers. He announced plans for a new Border Security Command, integrating intelligence and enforcement to dismantle smuggling networks <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. Starmer stressed that controlled migration benefits the economy, citing contributions from sectors like the NHS, where 20% of staff are foreign-born <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. However, he vowed to reduce net migration through measures targeting student dependents and care worker visas, responding to public demands without endorsing blanket restrictions <sup><a href="#ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The critique of Reform UK was incisive yet measured. Starmer described their policies as "the politics of the pub" – appealing in casual conversation but disastrous in practice <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. He specifically targeted Reform's call for a "freeze" on non-essential migration, arguing it would cripple industries reliant on international talent, such as technology and agriculture <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. Implicitly, Starmer linked Reform's rhetoric to far-right populism, warning that it "stokes division and hatred" without naming racism outright, though commentators interpreted it as such <sup><a href="#ref29">29</a></sup>. This echoed broader accusations; for instance, Farage's past comments on immigration have been scrutinised by equality watchdogs <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Starmer's approach contrasted with Reform's absolutism. While Reform proposes withdrawing from international treaties, Labour favours bilateral deals with France and Albania to curb crossings <sup><a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. Polling post-speech indicated mixed reception: 55% of the public approved Labour's immigration stance, but Reform supporters remained unmoved, with 70% viewing Starmer as "out of touch" <sup><a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Domestic Political Challenges: Leadership Doubts and Party Unity</h2>
            <p>The conference was overshadowed by internal Labour frictions. Delegates debated the government's fiscal restraint, including the winter fuel cut affecting 10 million pensioners <sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup>. Starmer dismissed leadership speculation as "distractions," focusing on long-term stability <sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup>. A Labour Together poll in September 2024 showed 52% of party members reluctant to back Starmer for 2029, citing delivery shortfalls <sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>These doubts stemmed from early governance hurdles. The 5% public sector pay rise in July 2024, funded by tax hikes, drew union ire <sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup>. Economically, GDP growth stalled at 0.6% in Q3 2024, with inflation at 2.2% <sup><a href="#ref36">36</a></sup>. Starmer countered by pledging infrastructure investment, including Great British Energy <sup><a href="#ref37">37</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Reform UK's threat amplified these pressures. Farage, attending the conference fringes, positioned his party as the true opposition, attracting disaffected Conservatives <sup><a href="#ref38">38</a></sup>. Starmer's response was to frame Reform as a symptom of unresolved grievances, urging unity against "declinism" <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>International Dimensions: AUKUS and Transatlantic Relations</h2>
            <p>Starmer's speech extended to foreign policy, highlighting AUKUS as a cornerstone of UK security <sup><a href="#ref39">39</a></sup>. Initiated in September 2021, the pact commits the UK to sharing nuclear propulsion technology with Australia, enhancing deterrence against regional threats <sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. In bilateral talks with Albanese on 26 September 2024, Starmer reaffirmed commitments, with Albanese praising Labour's "steady hand" amid domestic turbulence <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>This alliance underscores post-Brexit realignments. AUKUS supplements the Five Eyes intelligence network and counters China's assertiveness in the South China Sea <sup><a href="#ref40">40</a></sup>. For Labour, it balances progressive values with strategic imperatives, though critics question the £10 billion projected cost <sup><a href="#ref41">41</a></sup>. Albanese's endorsement bolstered Starmer, contrasting with US uncertainties under a potential Trump return <sup><a href="#ref42">42</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The conference also addressed Ukraine support and Gaza ceasefire calls, reflecting Labour's multilateralism <sup><a href="#ref43">43</a></sup>. These elements reinforced Starmer's narrative of a "secure and fair" Britain.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Implications for UK Immigration Policy</h2>
            <p>Starmer's remarks signal a evolution in Labour's immigration framework. Historically, the party oscillated between openness and restriction; under Blair, inflows doubled, while Corbyn's era emphasised humanitarianism <sup><a href="#ref44">44</a></sup>. The 2024 approach blends enforcement with integration, aiming for net migration below 300,000 annually <sup><a href="#ref45">45</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Challenges persist. The asylum backlog exceeds 100,000 cases, straining resources <sup><a href="#ref46">46</a></sup>. Reform's narrative exploits this, promising swift deportations <sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup>. Labour's response involves legislative reforms, including the Border Security Bill slated for 2025 <sup><a href="#ref47">47</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Socially, immigration debates intersect with racism concerns. The Runnymede Trust reports persistent institutional biases, with hate crimes rising 25% post-Brexit <sup><a href="#ref48">48</a></sup>. Starmer's implicit critique of Reform aligns with efforts to combat far-right extremism, as seen in the 2024 riots following misinformation <sup><a href="#ref49">49</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Economically, migration sustains growth; the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates a 1% GDP boost from skilled inflows <sup><a href="#ref50">50</a></sup>. Yet, regional disparities fuel resentment, with net migration concentrated in London and the South East <sup><a href="#ref51">51</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Public and Media Reception</h2>
            <p>Media coverage of the speech was polarised. The Guardian lauded its "passion and purpose," while The Telegraph deemed it "short on specifics" <sup><a href="#ref52">52</a></sup>. Public approval stood at 48%, per Ipsos, with immigration critiques resonating among Remain voters <sup><a href="#ref53">53</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>Reform UK retaliated, with Farage accusing Starmer of "virtue-signalling" <sup><a href="#ref54">54</a></sup>. This exchange highlights deepening polarisation, with 40% of Britons viewing immigration as culturally threatening <sup><a href="#ref55">55</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Long-Term Political Outlook</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, Starmer's conference performance sets the tone for Labour's tenure. By 2029, success hinges on migration reductions and economic gains <sup><a href="#ref56">56</a></sup>. Reform's momentum could erode Tory recovery, potentially leading to a fragmented right <sup><a href="#ref57">57</a></sup>.</p>

            <p>The fight against populism requires addressing root causes: inequality, housing shortages, and service strains <sup><a href="#ref58">58</a></sup>. Labour's strategy emphasises evidence-based policy, contrasting Reform's emotive appeals.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Keir Starmer's 2024 Labour conference speech encapsulated the complexities of governing a divided nation. By critiquing Reform UK's immigration stance as divisive, he sought to reclaim narrative control, while navigating leadership doubts and international commitments. This moment underscores the enduring challenge of balancing openness with security in UK politics. As debates evolve, scholarly attention must focus on equitable solutions that honour Britain's multicultural heritage.</p>
