            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The United States federal government endured its longest shutdown in history, a 40-day political deadlock that began on 1 October 2025 and eclipsed the previous record set during the first Trump administration<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The crisis was precipitated by a failure to agree on a federal budget, with the core dispute centring on the extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, a key demand of Senate Democrats<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The resulting paralysis forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, leading to widespread disruptions in critical services, including a mandated 10 per cent cut in flights at 40 major US airports<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. A bipartisan deal was eventually struck in the Senate, advancing a compromise bill that would fund the government through January 2026 and guarantee back pay for affected workers<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The political fallout was significant, with President Donald Trump's approval rating dropping to a second-term low of 37 per cent, while a majority of Americans blamed him and congressional Republicans for the impasse<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The episode underscored the deep partisan divisions in Washington and the profound economic and social cost of a dysfunctional appropriations process<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p>

        <section>
           <h2>The Longest Stalemate in American History</h2>
           <p>The federal government of the United States entered a state of partial shutdown on 1 October 2025, marking the beginning of the new fiscal year without an agreed-upon budget<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. This funding lapse quickly escalated into the longest government shutdown in the nation’s history, ultimately stretching to 40 days<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The previous record, a 35-day shutdown, had occurred during the first term of President Donald Trump between 2018 and 2019<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The immediate cause of the 2025 crisis was the failure of Congress to pass a continuing resolution to keep government operations funded<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The political impasse was rooted in a deep partisan disagreement over federal spending priorities and, crucially, the future of healthcare subsidies<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. House Republicans had initially proposed a ‘clean’ continuing resolution to fund the government through 21 November, but Senate Democrats refused to advance the legislation without a commitment to address the expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. These credits, which had been expanded during the pandemic, were set to lapse, a change that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated would raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The CBO also projected that extending the expansion would increase the number of insured Americans by 3.8 million by 2035<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. President Trump, who had returned to the White House for a second term, publicly stated that he would not be ‘extorted’ by Democrats and would only discuss the healthcare subsidies after the shutdown had ended<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This hardline stance from the executive branch, coupled with the Democratic insistence on protecting the ACA subsidies, created an intractable deadlock that paralysed the legislative process for over a month<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The shutdown affected numerous government programmes, including national parks and federal research operations, and led to the curtailment of agency activities and services<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Human and Economic Toll</h2>
           <p>The immediate and most visible impact of the funding lapse was the financial hardship imposed upon the federal workforce and the disruption of essential public services<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Over 750,000 federal employees were directly affected by the shutdown<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. This figure included approximately 730,000 workers who were furloughed without pay and an additional 670,000 essential employees who were required to continue working without receiving a paycheck<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Essential workers included air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, whose continued operation was critical for public safety and national security<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The lack of pay forced some federal employees to seek out temporary jobs or rely on food banks to make ends meet<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The ripple effects extended beyond the federal payroll, as private-sector contractors were idled, and local businesses near federal facilities experienced a sharp decline in revenue<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The economic consequences were substantial, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that the crisis would cost the US economy at least $7 billion by the end of 2026<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The CBO further projected that the cost could rise to $14 billion if the shutdown were to continue until the end of November<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The travel industry alone lost an estimated $5 billion in travel spending by early November<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The safety of the nation’s airspace became a major point of concern as the shutdown dragged on<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was already dealing with a longstanding shortage of approximately 3,000 air traffic controllers before the funding crisis began<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Staffing shortages led to a six-hour period on 8 October 2025 where the air traffic control tower at Hollywood Burbank Airport was left unstaffed, forcing pilots to coordinate among themselves<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. In response to the mounting stress on the system, the Transportation Secretary, Sean Duffy, announced a mandated 10 per cent cut in flights at 40 major US airports, effective from 7 November<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. This measure was intended to maintain air traffic control safety, but it resulted in more than 3.2 million passengers experiencing delayed or cancelled flights due to air traffic control staffing issues<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The cuts were expected to affect the busiest hubs, including those serving New York City, Washington DC, Chicago, and Los Angeles<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Beyond the immediate economic and travel disruptions, the shutdown also impacted social programmes, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which assists more than 42 million lower-income Americans<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Furthermore, the US Forest Service was forced to pause all prescribed burns, a critical measure for mitigating the risk of destructive wildfires, potentially setting the stage for more catastrophic fires in the following year<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Senate’s Bipartisan Breakthrough</h2>
           <p>As the shutdown entered its sixth week, a group of senators, including Democrats and the Independent Angus King of Maine, began negotiating a compromise to break the political logjam<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The bipartisan effort was led by Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Senator King, in coordination with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. On Sunday, 9 November 2025, the Senate reached a deal that would resume federal funding and signal an end to the record-long shutdown<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The legislative measure, a compromise bill, successfully cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, overcoming a filibuster with a vote of 60-40<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The bill required exactly 60 votes to advance, with nearly all Republicans voting in favour, joined by eight senators who caucus with the Democrats<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The agreement was structured as a ‘minibus’ package, which included three full-year appropriations bills for the Agriculture, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch departments<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The remaining government operations would be funded at existing spending levels through a continuing resolution set to expire on 30 January 2026<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. A critical component of the deal for federal workers was the guarantee that all employees laid off during the shutdown would be re-hired and receive back pay, as required by a 2019 law<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The bill also promised to reverse President Trump’s firings of federal employees that had occurred during the course of the shutdown<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The most contentious element of the compromise was the resolution of the healthcare subsidy dispute<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Instead of directly extending the expiring ACA premium tax credits, the deal included a promise that the Senate would hold a vote on a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies by the end of the second week of December<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. This concession was a major point of contention for many Democrats, including Senate Democratic leadership, who voted against advancing the bill<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Senator Chuck Schumer, the chamber’s top Democrat, expressed anger that the deal offered a vote on the subsidies rather than a direct extension<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Despite the opposition from their leadership, a sufficient number of Democrats joined Republicans to approve the bill, citing the need to end the funding lapse that was causing widespread harm<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The compromise bill still required approval from the Republican-led House of Representatives and President Trump’s signature before the government could fully reopen<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Political Reckoning</h2>
           <p>The protracted shutdown exacted a heavy political price on all parties involved, particularly President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. As the crisis deepened, public opinion polls reflected growing dissatisfaction with the political leadership in Washington<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. A CNN/SSRS poll released on 3 November 2025, found that President Trump’s approval rating had dropped to 37 per cent, the lowest recorded by the network during his second term in office<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. His disapproval rating reached 63 per cent, just one percentage point shy of his lowest mark ever recorded by CNN<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The survey, conducted as the shutdown was set to become the longest in history, also found that 68 per cent of Americans believed things in the US were going ‘pretty/very badly’<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The public assigned the most blame for the shutdown to the Republican side of the aisle<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. An Economist/YouGov poll found that 41 per cent of respondents blamed Republicans in Congress and President Trump for the funding lapse, compared to 30 per cent who blamed Democrats in Congress<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The political damage was not limited to the executive branch<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Amid the standoff, Americans’ approval rating of Congress declined by 11 percentage points to a mere 15 per cent<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The decline in congressional approval was largely driven by a sharp 21-point drop among Republicans<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Despite the negative polling, President Trump remained unfazed, publicly stating that he believed his first nine months in his second term were among the best of any president<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The political dynamics of the shutdown also highlighted the shifting priorities of the American electorate<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. While immigration had been a major focus of the Trump administration, only 10 per cent of Americans cited it as a top concern in the CNN/SSRS poll<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The economy and the cost of living were cited as the most important issue facing the country by 47 per cent of Americans<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The 40-day federal government shutdown of 2025 served as a stark demonstration of the fragility of the American appropriations process when confronted by deep partisan entrenchment<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The crisis, driven by a standoff over healthcare subsidies and the federal budget, inflicted billions of dollars in economic damage and placed immense strain on hundreds of thousands of federal workers and the critical services they provide<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The eventual bipartisan compromise in the Senate, while a necessary step to reopen the government, was a temporary measure that merely postponed the most difficult political decisions until January 2026<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The deal’s failure to secure a direct extension of the ACA premium tax credits, instead offering only a promise of a future vote, left the core issue unresolved and guaranteed a continuation of the political fight<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The political cost was clear, with President Trump’s approval ratings hitting a new low and the public assigning the majority of the blame to the Republican leadership<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The episode underscored a fundamental challenge in American governance: the increasing willingness of political factions to use the essential function of funding the government as a high-stakes negotiating tool, regardless of the widespread harm inflicted upon the economy and the citizenry<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The resolution of the 2025 shutdown was less a triumph of cooperation and more a temporary ceasefire in an ongoing war over the nation’s fiscal and social priorities<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
