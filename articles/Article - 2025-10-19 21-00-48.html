            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>Despite commanding a significant lead in national opinion polls, Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party is grappling with profound internal instability and a series of controversial appointments that threaten to undermine its image of common-sense competence. The party’s rapid growth has exposed deep fissures between its populist base and its attempts to professionalise, creating a volatile political entity that is simultaneously surging in public support and struggling with basic organisational discipline.</p>

           <h2>A Polling Lead Built on Volatility</h2>
           <p>The political landscape of the United Kingdom has been fundamentally reshaped by the dramatic rise of Reform UK, a party that has transitioned from a fringe protest movement to a dominant force in national polling<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. By September 2025<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, the party had achieved a record 35% vote share in a BMG Research poll for The i<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This figure represented more than double the support Reform UK received in the 2024 General Election<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The same poll indicated a 15-point lead over the Labour Party<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. A separate Ipsos poll, conducted later in September 2025<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, placed Reform UK on 34%<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, maintaining a 12-point advantage over Labour’s 22%<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The Conservative Party, meanwhile, was recorded at a historic low of 14%<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The shift in allegiance is stark: approximately 39% of those who voted Conservative in 2024 now state they would vote for Reform UK<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Labour’s vote has also fragmented, with 13% of its 2024 voters indicating a switch to Reform UK<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The party’s support is particularly strong among socio-economic groups C2DE, where it commands 51% of the vote intention share<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, and among non-graduates and those aged 50 and above, both registering 44% support<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The party’s momentum was further demonstrated in a Survation poll for the Caerphilly Senedd by-election in October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, which placed Reform UK in the lead with 42% of the vote<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. This surge is not confined to traditional demographics. Research by the 1928 Institute, released in October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, showed that support for Reform UK among British Indians had tripled since the last election<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, rising from 4% to 13%<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. This increase is significantly higher than the national average rise for the party<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, suggesting a broadening appeal in communities where it has historically struggled<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The party’s success is largely attributed to its focus on immigration, which 90% of its voters name as their top issue<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>, and the cost of living<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Nigel Farage himself was rated as the most capable Prime Minister by 25% of respondents in the September 2025 Ipsos poll<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, ahead of Keir Starmer on 19%<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> and Kemi Badenoch on 9%<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Theologian and the Culture War</h2>
           <p>The party’s attempt to professionalise its operation and broaden its intellectual base has been overshadowed by the controversial appointment of James Orr as a senior adviser to Nigel Farage<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Mr Orr, an associate professor of the history of religion at Cambridge University<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, is a prominent right-wing theologian<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. His appointment, announced in October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, immediately drew criticism due to his publicly stated views<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Mr Orr is known for his absolute opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. He has also used provocative language to describe asylum seekers, referring to them as “invaders”<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Reform UK’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, defended the appointment, describing Mr Orr as a “brilliant academic, theologian, thinker”<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> and a “bastion of common sense and patriotism at Cambridge University”<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Mr Yusuf stated that Mr Orr would have a “pivotal role in shaping the future of this country”<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The move was immediately condemned by political opponents, with a Labour spokesperson arguing that the appointment revealed the direction the party was taking<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, claimed the appointment confirmed that Reform UK was merely a “British franchise of Donald Trump’s MAGA movement”<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Mr Orr’s influence extends across the Atlantic; he is an influential figure within the US conservative movement<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, and Vice President J.D. Vance has referred to him as his “British sherpa”<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The appointment followed a visit by Mr Orr and former Conservative MP Danny Kruger to meet Mr Vance in the summer of 2025<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>, shortly before Mr Kruger’s defection to Reform UK<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Despite the controversy, Reform UK has denied that the party is shifting towards an anti-abortion policy stance<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>Infighting in the Flagship Council</h2>
           <p>The internal strains of managing a rapidly expanding political operation were dramatically exposed by a leaked video from a Reform UK meeting at Kent County Council<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Kent County Council is one of ten local authorities where Reform UK holds outright control<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The leaked footage, which emerged in October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, captured a chaotic internal meeting where the leader of the Reform UK group, Linden Kemkaran<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>, was seen shouting down fellow councillors<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The recording showed councillors complaining about “backbiting” and feeling ignored by their leader<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. During the August 2025 meeting<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, which focused on disagreements over the council’s budget and national plans for local government reform (LGR)<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>, Ms Kemkaran used profanity, telling those who disagreed with decisions that they would have to “fucking suck it up”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. She also threatened to ‘mute’ a fellow councillor<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Following the publication of the video, Ms Kemkaran sent a message to her colleagues<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, announcing that she had launched a “thorough investigation” to find the source of the leak<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. She referred to the leakers as “cowards”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, “weak,” and “foolish,” accusing them of “treachery”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Ms Kemkaran stated that she had passed her suspicions about the responsible parties to Reform UK’s head office<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, adding that the guilty individuals would be expelled<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The leader of the Labour-controlled Medway Council, Vince Maple, issued a statement seeking clarification after Ms Kemkaran claimed in the leaked meeting that other Kent council leaders disliked her because she was a woman<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Mr Maple dismissed the suggestion as “utterly ludicrous”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, stating that it contradicted the collaborative approach taken by Kent councils on LGR plans<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The incident highlighted the deep divisions and lack of internal cohesion within the party’s local government operations<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Challenge of Institutionalisation</h2>
           <p>The simultaneous surge in public support and the eruption of internal disputes present a fundamental challenge to the party’s long-term viability<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The polling figures suggest a profound public appetite for the party’s core message, particularly on immigration and the cost of living<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The party’s ability to attract a significant portion of both former Conservative and former Labour voters indicates a successful positioning as the primary anti-establishment vehicle<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. However, the internal chaos in Kent, coupled with the divisive nature of appointments like James Orr’s, suggests a party struggling to manage the transition from a protest movement to a credible political institution<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The public focus on the leader’s personality, Nigel Farage<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, and the party’s ability to attract defectors like Danny Kruger<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> and former Scottish Tory MSP Graham Simpson<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>, has masked a deeper issue of organisational maturity<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The party’s rapid expansion has brought in individuals with disparate political backgrounds and strong, often conflicting, personal agendas<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The tension between the party’s populist, anti-system rhetoric and the necessity of running complex local authorities, such as Kent County Council, has created a volatile environment<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The party’s leadership must now reconcile its image as a champion of common sense with the reality of internal feuds and the political fallout from controversial ideological appointments<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>Reform UK stands at a critical juncture, holding a commanding lead in national polls that would, if replicated at a general election, deliver a landslide majority<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. This success is driven by a clear focus on issues like immigration and the cost of living, which resonate deeply with a broad, disaffected electorate<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Yet, the party’s internal structure appears fragile, characterised by the public exposure of bitter infighting at its highest-profile local authority in Kent<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Furthermore, the appointment of a figure like James Orr, with his strong ideological positions on issues such as abortion, risks importing the divisive culture wars of US politics and alienating potential moderate supporters<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The central question for the party is whether its populist momentum, driven by the personal brand of Nigel Farage, can overcome the structural and ideological instability that its rapid ascent has exposed<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The coming months will determine if the party can professionalise its operation without sacrificing the anti-establishment energy that has propelled it to the forefront of British politics<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
