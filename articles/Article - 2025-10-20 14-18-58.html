            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>The Hindu festival of Diwali in 2025 was marked by a spectacular, record-breaking display of devotion in the ancient city of Ayodhya, where millions of earthen lamps illuminated the Saryu riverbanks. This monumental celebration of cultural heritage and national identity coincided with a massive surge in consumer spending that buoyed the Indian economy. Simultaneously, the capital, New Delhi, was enveloped in a toxic blanket of smog, with air quality plunging to hazardous levels, underscoring the profound and often contradictory forces shaping modern India's most significant annual event.</p>

           <h2>A Record-Breaking Illumination on the Saryu</h2>
           <p>The city of Ayodhya, revered as the birthplace of Lord Rama, became the focal point of the 2025 Diwali celebrations, hosting the ninth edition of the Deepotsav festival. The event, which took place on the eve of the main festival day, was a monumental display of cultural and spiritual fervour, culminating in the setting of two new Guinness World Records. The primary record was achieved for the largest display of oil lamps, with an astonishing 2,617,215 *diyas*—small earthen lamps—lit simultaneously along the ghats of the sacred Saryu River. This figure surpassed the previous year’s count of 25.12 lakh (2,512,000) lamps, continuing a trend of increasing scale that began with 1.71 lakh (171,000) lamps in 2017. The sheer logistics of the operation were immense, requiring the coordinated effort of over 30,000 volunteers drawn from universities, colleges, and various administrative departments. The lamps were arranged in precise patterns to facilitate accurate counting and verification by representatives from Guinness World Records, who used drone technology to certify the final number. The second world record was set for the most people performing a simultaneous *diya* rotation, or *aarti*, with 2,128 devotees participating in the synchronised ritual. The Deepotsav was jointly organised by the Uttar Pradesh Department of Tourism, the Ayodhya district administration, and the Rammanohar Lohia Avadh University. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath presided over the grand affair, receiving the official Guinness World Records certificates. The Chief Minister used the occasion to highlight the state government’s efforts to preserve the identity and faith of the people, noting that the festival also supported local livelihoods, particularly those of the Prajapati and Kumhar communities who craft the earthen lamps. The celebrations were further enhanced by a grand drone show, laser and light displays, and traditional Ram Leela performances at Ram Ki Paidi.</p>

           <h2>The Spiritual Victory of Light Over Darkness</h2>
           <p>Diwali, or Deepavali, is the most widely celebrated Hindu festival, a five-day observance that symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The main day of the festival in 2025 fell on Monday, October 20. The date is determined by the Hindu lunisolar calendar, specifically falling on the new moon day (*Amavasya Tithi*) of the month of Kartik. The festival’s significance is rooted in several ancient narratives, the most prominent in northern India being the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya. According to the epic Ramayana, the festival marks the day Rama, his wife Sita, his brother Lakshmana, and the deity Hanuman returned to Ayodhya after a fourteen-year exile and the defeat of the demon king Ravana. The citizens of Ayodhya are said to have lit up the entire city with *diyas* to welcome their king home, a tradition that the modern Deepotsav seeks to recreate on a monumental scale. The five-day structure of the festival begins with Dhanteras, or Dhanatrayodashi, on Saturday, October 18, 2025. This day is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth, and Lord Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods. It is considered an auspicious time for purchasing gold, silver, or new utensils, marking the beginning of the new financial year for many Indian businesses. The second day, Narak Chaturdashi, or Choti Diwali, on Sunday, October 19, 2025, commemorates Lord Krishna’s victory over the demon Narakasura. The third day is the main Diwali, or Lakshmi Puja, on October 20, when families perform rituals to invoke the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity. The final two days are Govardhana Puja and Bhai Dooj, which celebrate the bond between husband and wife and between brothers and sisters, respectively.</p>

           <h2>The Economic Pulse of the Nation</h2>
           <p>Beyond its spiritual and cultural resonance, the Diwali season serves as the most significant annual catalyst for India’s consumer-led economy. The festival is responsible for the highest levels of consumer spending throughout the year, driven by a cultural imperative to make discretionary purchases. This surge in demand provides a critical boost to the country’s growth momentum. Industry estimates for the 2025 festive season projected consumer spending to scale to approximately Rs 3.5 lakh crore (3.5 trillion rupees), representing a 20 per cent increase over the previous year. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has, in strong years, estimated seasonal sales to exceed ₹3.75 lakh crore. The spending is widely distributed across various sectors, including new clothing, jewellery, electronics, home décor, and festive foods. The sweets and confectionery sector alone generates more than 30 per cent of its annual turnover during these festive weeks. The economic impact extends deep into the informal economy, providing a vital injection of demand for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro enterprises (MSMEs). Artisans, *diya* potters, and craft clusters, such as those who produced the millions of lamps for the Ayodhya Deepotsav, rely heavily on this period for their income. Furthermore, the season is considered auspicious for major financial decisions, leading to a noticeable increase in property and auto sales. The retail and logistics sectors hire numerous temporary workers to manage the increased demand for goods and services, creating seasonal employment opportunities. This collective spending and economic activity is viewed by analysts as a demonstration of India’s internal economic resilience, providing a structural impulse that helps sustain or boost economic growth.</p>

           <h2>The Shadow of the Smog in the Capital</h2>
           <p>In stark contrast to the luminous celebrations in Ayodhya, the national capital region (NCR) of New Delhi experienced a severe environmental crisis during the 2025 Diwali period. The city woke up on the main festival day, Monday, October 20, under a thick blanket of toxic air, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) plunging into the ‘severe’ category at several monitoring stations. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed AQI readings exceeding 400 in multiple areas. Anand Vihar, for instance, logged an AQI of 414 at 6 a.m. on Monday, while the reading near Akshardham was 411. An AQI above 400 is classified as ‘severe,’ posing a serious health risk to the population. The deterioration began on the eve of Diwali, Sunday, October 19, when the city’s average AQI climbed from ‘poor’ to the ‘very poor’ red zone. The toxic mix was attributed to a combination of factors: emissions from firecrackers, vehicular pollution, and the seasonal influx of pollutants, including smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring states. Transport emissions alone were estimated to account for approximately 15.1 per cent of the capital’s pollution on the Sunday before Diwali. In an attempt to mitigate the crisis, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) enforced Stage 2 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). These measures included tighter restrictions on diesel generators and limits on the entry of certain interstate buses into Delhi. Furthermore, the Supreme Court had previously permitted the use of ‘green firecrackers’ only within designated time slots—6 a.m. to 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.—on the festival day. However, widespread violations and calm wind conditions meant the smog was expected to persist for several days, with no significant respite anticipated until later in the week. The annual recurrence of the smog crisis highlights the profound public health challenge that accompanies the cultural and economic exuberance of the festival in the NCR.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The 2025 Diwali celebration presented a powerful duality, encapsulating the complex trajectory of modern India. On one hand, the Deepotsav in Ayodhya, with its two Guinness World Records and millions of glowing *diyas*, served as a potent symbol of resurgent cultural pride and the successful mobilisation of state resources to celebrate a core national narrative. This spectacle, alongside the projected multi-trillion-rupee surge in consumer spending, affirmed the festival’s indispensable role as both a spiritual anchor and a vital economic engine. On the other hand, the simultaneous public health emergency in New Delhi, where the Air Quality Index soared into the ‘severe’ category, exposed the environmental cost of tradition and rapid urbanisation. The contrast between the luminous banks of the Saryu and the choking haze over the Yamuna underscores a critical national challenge: reconciling the desire for grand, uninhibited cultural expression and economic growth with the urgent necessity of environmental sustainability and public health. The festival of lights continues to illuminate the nation’s deepest traditions, but it also casts a sharp shadow over its most pressing contemporary dilemmas.</p>
