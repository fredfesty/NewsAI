            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>The posthumous publication of Virginia Giuffre's memoir has reignited the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew, Duke of York, with a new, explosive allegation that his team attempted to hire internet trolls to harass her. This revelation, coupled with claims of a separate smear campaign, has intensified political pressure on the British government and the monarchy to formally strip the Prince of his remaining hereditary titles, forcing a confrontation with the archaic legal mechanisms governing the peerage.</p>

           <h2>A Voice from Beyond the Grave</h2>
           <p>The release of Virginia Giuffre’s memoir, *Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice*<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>, has cast a fresh and deeply unsettling shadow over the British royal family and the Duke of York<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The book, co-written with journalist Amy Wallace<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, was completed before Ms Giuffre’s death by suicide in April 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Its publication, scheduled for Tuesday, October 22, 2025<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>, arrives at a moment when the Prince had already been forced to relinquish the use of his titles and honours<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. The memoir provides an expanded and harrowing account of Ms Giuffre’s experiences, detailing how she was allegedly trafficked by the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre first encountered Epstein in the summer of 2000, weeks before her seventeenth birthday, while working at a spa at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. She recounts how Epstein and Maxwell, whom she describes as a “master manipulator”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, preyed on her vulnerabilities, offering a false “lifeline” to a girl who had experienced a traumatic childhood<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The book alleges that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. One of these alleged encounters took place in March 2001 at Ms Maxwell’s London flat, where the now-infamous photograph of the Prince with his arm around Ms Giuffre’s waist was taken<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. She claims she was paid $15,000 for “servicing” the Prince<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The Prince has consistently and vehemently denied all of Ms Giuffre’s allegations of sexual assault and has maintained that he has no recollection of ever meeting her<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Allegation of Digital Harassment</h2>
           <p>The most immediate and politically damaging revelation in the memoir is the claim concerning a campaign of digital harassment<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre wrote that after casting doubt on her credibility for a prolonged period, Prince Andrew’s “team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me”<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. This allegation suggests a deliberate, organised effort to undermine her reputation and mental well-being in the public sphere, extending the controversy beyond the original claims of sexual assault and into the realm of modern information warfare<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. The context for this alleged action is the protracted legal battle that culminated in a civil settlement<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against the Prince in New York on August 9, 2021<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>, alleging that she was forced to have sexual encounters with him in the early 2000s<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The Prince’s legal team initially attempted to have the case dismissed, citing a previously secret $500,000 settlement Ms Giuffre had reached with Epstein in 2009<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. However, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected this attempt on January 12, 2022, allowing the lawsuit to proceed<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The prospect of the Prince giving a sworn deposition and facing a public trial was averted when an out-of-court settlement was reached on February 15, 2022<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The settlement, for an undisclosed sum reported to be as high as £12 million<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>, included a “substantial donation” to Ms Giuffre’s charity for victims’ rights<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Crucially, the settlement contained no admission of guilt from the Prince<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The memoir’s new claims of a coordinated online attack now place the Prince’s associates under renewed scrutiny regarding the tactics employed during the legal and public relations fight<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Furthermore, the Metropolitan Police confirmed they are “actively looking into” separate claims that the Prince passed Ms Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number to a personal protection officer in 2011, allegedly to facilitate a smear campaign to “dig up dirt” on her<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Political Demand for Deprivation</h2>
           <p>The new allegations have immediately intensified the political campaign to formally strip the Prince of his remaining hereditary titles<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. On Friday, October 17, 2025, the Prince announced that, following discussions with King Charles III, he would cease using his titles and honours, including the Duke of York title, the Earl of Inverness, the Baron Killyleagh, and his knighthood as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. This voluntary renunciation, however, does not legally remove the titles, which remain extant but inactive<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The only mechanism to permanently remove a peerage, whether royal or not, is through an Act of Parliament<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, has been the most vocal proponent of legislative action, arguing that the city of York, which she represents, is a “human rights city” that should not be associated with the disgraced royal<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Ms Maskell has called for a change in the law to grant the monarch the power to remove titles, or for a joint parliamentary committee to make such a recommendation<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. She has previously sought to introduce a ‘Removal of Titles Bill’ to address this legal lacuna<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The Scottish National Party’s Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, has also publicly supported the need for an Act of Parliament, stating that the public deserves to know that MPs “share their outrage”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, a senior government minister, indicated that Parliament should consider changing the laws if the King deemed it necessary, though she suggested the government would be “guided by the royal family” on the matter<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The political consensus is that the current situation, where the Prince retains the title legally but has promised not to use it, is an unsustainable compromise that fails to satisfy public and parliamentary demands for a definitive break<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Archaic Law of Peerage</h2>
           <p>The difficulty in formally removing the Duke of York title stems from the archaic and complex legal framework governing the British peerage<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Unlike the Prince’s military titles and the use of his ‘His Royal Highness’ (HRH) style, which were removed by Queen Elizabeth II in January 2022 under the monarch’s prerogative<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>, a hereditary peerage is a legal entity that can only be extinguished by an Act of Parliament<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The most recent and relevant precedent for the deprivation of titles is the Titles Deprivation Act 1917<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. This legislation was enacted during the First World War to strip British peerages and royal titles from those who had borne arms against the Crown or supported Germany<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Specifically, it targeted three German princes and one duke, including the Duke of Albany and the Duke of Cumberland<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The Act required a specially appointed committee of the Privy Council to identify the individuals before the King could issue a formal declaration of deprivation<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. Before 1917, the primary method for removing a peerage was through an Act of Attainder, a medieval and early modern parliamentary tool that convicted and sentenced a person for a serious crime, usually treason, without a formal trial<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The last use of an Act of Attainder against a peer occurred in 1745<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Legal experts suggest that a new, short piece of legislation, similar to the 2022 bill that made the Princess Royal and Prince Edward Counsellors of State, could be passed relatively quickly to address the current situation<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. However, the political will of the government and the explicit desire of the Palace are necessary for such a bill to be tabled and passed<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The Prince’s title of ‘Prince’ is a birthright, as the son of a Queen, and cannot be removed by the monarch or Parliament, though the style of HRH can be removed by Letters Patent<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Shadow of Epstein and the Newsnight Interview</h2>
           <p>The current crisis is the culmination of a decade-long association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in a Manhattan prison cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Prince Andrew’s friendship with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges and is serving a 20-year sentence<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, has been the central cause of his public downfall<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Prince’s attempt to clear his name in a BBC *Newsnight* interview in November 2019 proved disastrous<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. During the interview with Emily Maitlis, the Prince expressed no regret for his friendship with Epstein, stating that the people he met and the opportunities he was given were “actually very useful”<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. He offered a series of explanations for the allegations, including a claim that he could not have been in London on the night of the alleged encounter because he had taken his daughter, Princess Beatrice, to a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking<sup><a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. He also claimed that a medical condition prevented him from sweating, contradicting Ms Giuffre’s recollection that he was “sweating profusely” while dancing at Tramp nightclub<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. Ms Giuffre’s memoir describes the *Newsnight* interview as an “injection of jet fuel” for her legal team, as it raised the possibility of subpoenaing members of the royal family, including his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and his daughters<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The public reaction to the interview was overwhelmingly negative, leading to a rapid withdrawal of his public duties and the eventual stripping of his military titles and HRH style by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in January 2022<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The settlement a month later, in February 2022, brought the civil case to an end but did not resolve the underlying reputational damage or the political issue of his remaining titles<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Mechanics of a Smear Campaign</h2>
           <p>The dual allegations of a digital harassment campaign and a separate attempt to dig up personal information on Ms Giuffre highlight the aggressive, behind-the-scenes tactics allegedly employed by the Prince’s associates<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. The claim that his team sought to hire “internet trolls” suggests an awareness and willingness to engage in modern, asymmetric warfare against an accuser in the court of public opinion<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Such campaigns typically involve the creation of anonymous or pseudonymous accounts to spread disinformation, amplify negative narratives, and personally attack the credibility of a target across social media platforms and online forums<sup><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The goal is to create a hostile online environment that discourages the victim from speaking out and sows doubt among the public and media<sup><a href="#ref-27">27</a></sup>. The separate claim, now under review by the Metropolitan Police, that the Prince provided his bodyguard with Ms Giuffre’s date of birth and social security number in 2011 for the purpose of a smear campaign, suggests a long-standing effort to discredit her<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. This alleged action predates the 2021 civil lawsuit and indicates that the Prince and his circle were actively concerned about Ms Giuffre’s public statements for over a decade<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The Metropolitan Police’s decision to ‘actively’ look into the claims, which were reported by the *Mail on Sunday*, adds a potential criminal dimension to the Prince’s ongoing legal and public relations woes<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The combination of alleged digital harassment and the reported attempt to gather personal data for a smear campaign paints a picture of a coordinated, multi-faceted effort to silence or discredit a key witness, a strategy that has now backfired with the posthumous publication of her full account<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The posthumous voice of Virginia Giuffre, amplified by the detailed allegations in *Nobody’s Girl*<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>, has created a new and profound crisis for the House of Windsor<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The claims of a digital harassment campaign and a separate attempt to orchestrate a smear campaign against Ms Giuffre<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> have moved the controversy from a historical sexual assault allegation to a contemporary issue of alleged character assassination and abuse of power<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Prince Andrew’s voluntary renunciation of the use of his titles on October 17, 2025<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>, has proven insufficient to quell the political storm<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The calls from MPs like Rachael Maskell and Stephen Flynn for a formal Act of Parliament to strip the Duke of York title<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> represent a direct challenge to the Crown’s traditional prerogative and the antiquated laws of the peerage<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The political pressure is now focused on the government and King Charles III to decide whether to maintain a legal fiction—a Duke who cannot use his title—or to engage in a legislative process not seen since the Titles Deprivation Act of 1917<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The enduring crisis demonstrates that the Prince’s association with Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent legal and public relations fallout continue to pose a fundamental threat to the reputation of the monarchy, demanding a final, legislative resolution to an issue that has plagued the royal family for years<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>.</p>
