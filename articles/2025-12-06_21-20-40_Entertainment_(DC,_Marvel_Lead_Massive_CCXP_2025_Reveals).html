            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The Comic-Con Experience (CCXP) in São Paulo, Brazil, cemented its status as a critical launchpad for global entertainment in December 2025, with major studios unveiling exclusive footage and key details for their 2026 and 2027 slates. Marvel Studios and DC Studios dominated the international headlines, offering fans a first look at the gritty, punk-rock tone of the Supergirl film and the dark, street-level return of Daredevil: Born Again. Amazon Prime Video delivered a major update on the highly anticipated second season of Fallout, confirming its setting in the Mojave Wasteland and the iconic town of Novac. Crucially, the event also highlighted the growing strength of Brazilian national content, with MSP Studios announcing a new theme park and immersive exhibition celebrating the 90th birthday of cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa, while Prime Video showcased the expanded scope of its local hit series, Cangaço Novo. The convention served as a vital bridge between Hollywood's biggest franchises and the passionate, rapidly expanding Latin American market.</p>

           <h2>The New Global Stage for Hollywood's Biggest Reveals</h2>
           <p>The Comic-Con Experience, or CCXP, held annually in São Paulo, Brazil, has evolved from a regional fan convention into a mandatory stop on the global promotional circuit for major film and television studios<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The 2025 edition, which ran from December 4th to December 7th, reinforced this shift, with Hollywood’s biggest players using the Thunder Stage as a platform for exclusive, in-the-room-only announcements<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The event’s timing, positioned at the close of the calendar year, allows studios to generate significant buzz for their upcoming slates, particularly those scheduled for release in the first half of the following year<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The sheer scale of the convention, which transforms the São Paulo Expo into a massive entertainment pavilion, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, making it a crucial nexus for pop culture in Latin America<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The four-day festival featured a diverse programme, including panels with international celebrities, autograph sessions, and previews across cinema, television, comics, and games<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The presence of major international stars, such as Tom Wlaschiha and Dominic Monaghan, alongside a large contingent of the cast from the long-running series Supernatural, underscored the event’s global appeal<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>DC Studios Embraces the Cosmic and the Punk Rock</h2>
           <p>Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Studios delivered some of the most anticipated news of the convention, focusing heavily on their 2026 film slate<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The presentation centred on the upcoming film *Supergirl*, starring Milly Alcock as Kara Zor-El, which is scheduled for release on June 26, 2026<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn provided a pre-recorded message for the audience, confirming that a 'sneak peek' of the Craig Gillespie-directed movie would debut exclusively at the event<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The footage immediately established a tone distinct from the studio’s other superhero properties, leaning into a grittier, louder, and more colourful aesthetic<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The teaser opened with a surprisingly grounded and comedic moment, showing Krypto the Superdog lifting his leg to urinate on a space rock<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The camera then panned to Kara, who appeared dishevelled and groggy, seemingly nursing a significant hangover<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. This light-hearted start quickly transitioned as the iconic sound of a Blondie song, rumoured to be 'Call Me,' kicked in, launching a fast-paced montage of stylised action<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The montage featured Kara blasting through cosmic environments and delivering brutal punches to alien threats, showcasing a Supergirl who is ready to fight<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The film is based on Tom King’s acclaimed comic book series, *Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow*, which tells the story of a Kara Zor-El who is 'more hardcore' after witnessing the destruction of her world for the first 14 years of her life<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The display at the CCXP booth also offered a detailed look at Milly Alcock’s costume, which appeared similar to the one seen in the *Superman* film, and included a minor tease for the cosmic bounty hunter Lobo, played by Jason Momoa, via artwork of his signature axe<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The film will also feature Eve Ridley as Ruthye Mary Knolle and Matthias Schoenaerts as the villainous Krem of the Yellow Hills<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Return of the Devil of Hell's Kitchen</h2>
           <p>Disney+ and Marvel Studios used their panel to focus on their expanding television universe, with exclusive footage from two of their most anticipated 2026 series<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The presentation confirmed that *Wonder Man* and *Daredevil: Born Again* Season 2 would be among the highlights, with both series set to debut in the first quarter of 2026<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. *Wonder Man*, which is set to kick off Marvel Studios’ 2026 slate on January 27, is described as a comedic look at the world of superhero filmmaking<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The sneak peek shown to the audience featured Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Simon Williams, the titular character, in a scene where he smashes a table in frustration, finally revealing his powers<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. The footage also included a moment where Williams is conflicted about signing a form that requires him to deny having any superpowers, a nod to the series’ satirical take on Hollywood<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Ben Kingsley is set to reprise his role as Trevor Slattery, the actor who previously impersonated the Mandarin<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The most significant reveal, however, was the exclusive footage from *Daredevil: Born Again* Season 2, which is scheduled to premiere in March 2026<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The clip confirmed the return of Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones, a former ally from the Defenders, and showed Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock experiencing what appeared to be a seizure<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. The footage also introduced Matthew Lillard as the new antagonist, Mr. Charles, a character described as representing a new class of power players on the international stage, challenging Wilson Fisk’s control of New York<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Another description of the exclusive footage detailed a dark, tense scene reminiscent of the character’s comic book roots, with Matt Murdock chained in a cold room, using his heightened senses to track a barely alive person<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. This was followed by a tense rooftop confrontation between Daredevil and Frank Castle, also known as The Punisher<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The show’s creative team confirmed that a third season has already been greenlit, securing the future of the street-level hero in the cinematic universe<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>

        <section>
           <h2>The Mojave Wasteland and the Westerosi Hedge Knight</h2>
           <p>Amazon Prime Video and HBO Max also used the CCXP stage to provide crucial updates on their major genre properties<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The *Fallout* Season 2 panel, featuring stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins, and Justin Theroux, was a major draw, with the cast surprising over 3,500 fans at the Thunder Stage<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The highly anticipated second season, which premieres on December 17, will follow the trio’s journey through the Mojave Wasteland toward the ruins of New Vegas<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. An exclusive clip was shown, confirming the inclusion of the fan-favourite town of Novac, identifiable by the iconic Dinky the T-Rex structure<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The scene depicted Lucy (Purnell) attempting to negotiate with dangerous Wastelanders for the release of The Ghoul (Goggins), who was dangling by his neck in a pool<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. This moment highlighted Lucy’s moral evolution and the difficult choices she faces on her journey<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Walton Goggins noted that the second season was more difficult to shoot than the first, likening the larger story to the process of making a feature film [Ref: 7 in Step 1]. The season will also explore the origins of Mr. House, played by Justin Theroux, through pre-war flashbacks featuring Cooper Howard, The Ghoul’s pre-apocalypse identity<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. <br><br>Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max division focused on its *Game of Thrones* prequel, *A Knight of Seven Kingdoms*<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Stars Peter Claffey (Ser Duncan the Tall) and Dexter Sol Ansell (Egg) unveiled the final trailer for the first season, which is set to premiere on January 18, 2026<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The series, based on George R.R. Martin’s *Tales of Dunk and Egg* novellas, is set a century before the events of *Game of Thrones* and follows the adventures of a naive but courageous hedge knight and his young squire, who is secretly a Targaryen prince<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The panel also provided a significant update on the show’s future, with Claffey announcing that filming for the already-renewed second season would begin the following Tuesday, December 9th<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The second season is confirmed to feature the controversial location of Dorne, a region of Westeros that was previously a point of contention among fans of the original series<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. <br><br>Further details emerged regarding the DC Studios series *Lanterns*, which is being developed for HBO Max<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. The show, which has been described as a 'terrestrial-based TV show' in the vein of *True Detective*, will follow Green Lanterns Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler) and John Stewart (Aaron Pierre) as they investigate a murder in the American heartland<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. A teaser screened for the press revealed a 'western' vibe with brownish tones and a brief scene of Hal Jordan flying, though no full costumes were shown<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The teaser also included a mention of the fan-favourite squirrel Green Lantern, Ch’p<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The series, which is a foundational part of the new DC Universe, has had its release date pushed back to the end of summer 2026<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The New Face of Classic Horror and Mortal Kombat's Tournament</h2>
           <p>Warner Bros. also used the CCXP platform to generate excitement for its major 2026 film releases outside of the superhero genre, including a new take on a classic horror icon and the sequel to a popular video game adaptation<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. *The Bride*, directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is a radical reimagining of *The Bride of Frankenstein*, set in 1930s Chicago with a distinct punk aesthetic<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. The film, which is set for release on March 6, 2026, stars Jessie Buckley as the titular Bride and Christian Bale as Frankenstein’s monster<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Gyllenhaal, who was inspired to revisit the story after seeing a man with a Bride of Frankenstein tattoo, noted that her version of the Bride speaks extensively, a stark contrast to the original 1935 film where the character is silent<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. The plot centres on the reanimated Bride and the Monster becoming fugitives as they seek to avenge her murder<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. The film’s tagline, 'Here Comes the Motherfucking Bride,' further underscores the project’s rebellious and modernised tone<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. <br><br>New Line Cinema’s *Mortal Kombat 2* was also a major focus, with the sequel promising to deliver the full-blown Mortal Kombat tournament that the 2021 reboot largely avoided<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. The film, which is scheduled for an October 24, 2025, release, will feature a host of new characters from the video game franchise<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Confirmed new additions to the cast include Karl Urban as the charismatic Hollywood action star Johnny Cage, Adeline Rudolph as Princess Kitana, Martyn Ford as the tyrannical Shao Kahn, Tati Gabrielle as Jade, and Damon Herriman as the sorcerer Quan Chi<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The sequel is expected to be a very gory and bloody follow-up, with New Line chief Richard Brenner promising 'amazing fights, epic battles and a few fatalities'<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Ascendancy of Brazilian Pop Culture</h2>
           <p>Beyond the international blockbusters, CCXP 2025 served as a powerful showcase for the burgeoning strength and diversity of Brazilian national content, demonstrating the country’s cultural influence in the global entertainment market<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The local highlight was the 'Mauricio 90 - Uma Viagem no Tempo' panel, which celebrated the 90th birthday of the legendary cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa, the creator of the iconic *Turma da Mônica* (Monica and Friends) franchise<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. MSP Studios, the company responsible for his work, announced a significant expansion into immersive experiences for 2026 and beyond<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The centrepiece of this expansion is the *Expo VIVA Mauricio*, a large-scale immersive exhibition set to open on December 17th in Rio de Janeiro, which will feature rare documents, original art, and sensory recreations of emblematic settings like the Lemon Tree Neighbourhood and Horácio’s pre-history<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Furthermore, the studio announced the *Parque do Chico Bento*, a theme park dedicated to the beloved country boy character, scheduled to open in Campos do Jordão in 2027<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. In the audiovisual space, MSP Studios confirmed the second season of the animated series *Biduzidos*<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. <br><br>Amazon Prime Video also dedicated a significant portion of its panel to its Brazilian original productions<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The second season of the hit series *Cangaço Novo* was announced for an April 2026 premiere, with the cast confirming that the new episodes will feature a 'monumental' level of action and required extensive stunt training<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The plot for the new season will see the main characters, Ubaldo and Dinorah, adopt an audacious strategy of robbing banks to finance the purchase of essential public services for the city of Cratará, which is suffering from a corrupt-induced water crisis<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The panel also showcased the new original film *Corrida dos Bichos* (Race of the Animals), a dystopian thriller set in a Rio de Janeiro where the sea has dried up<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The film features a star-studded Brazilian ensemble cast, including Rodrigo Santoro, Isis Valverde, and Bruno Gagliasso<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The sheer volume and quality of the announcements at CCXP 2025 confirmed the event’s indispensable role in the global entertainment calendar, moving it far beyond the status of a mere regional convention<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The exclusive footage and detailed updates from Marvel, DC, and Amazon Prime Video demonstrated a strategic recognition of the Latin American audience as a primary driver of global pop culture consumption<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The dual focus on international blockbusters, such as the gritty, punk-rock *Supergirl* and the dark, detective-style *Lanterns*, alongside the ambitious expansion of local properties like *Turma da Mônica* and *Cangaço Novo*, illustrates a mature and sophisticated entertainment market<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The convention successfully bridged the gap between Hollywood’s biggest franchises and the rich, expanding universe of Brazilian storytelling, setting the narrative for the entertainment landscape of 2026 and beyond<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
