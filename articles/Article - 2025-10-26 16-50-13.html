            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>Hurricane Melissa, a rapidly intensifying Category 4 storm, is poised to make landfall in Jamaica as a potentially catastrophic Category 5 system, threatening the island with life-threatening storm surge and up to 40 inches of rain. The storm's slow movement is expected to prolong its destructive impact, raising the spectre of the most powerful hurricane to strike the nation in its modern history.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Monster on the Horizon</h2>
           <p>The Caribbean is facing a crisis as Hurricane Melissa, a powerful and rapidly intensifying storm, bears down on Jamaica and the island of Hispaniola<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. As of Sunday, 26 October 2025, Melissa had strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that the storm was still intensifying and could reach Category 5 status by Sunday night or Monday morning<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. This explosive strengthening saw Melissa jump from a tropical storm on Saturday morning to a Category 4 monster by early Sunday, a pace of intensification that was twice the rate required to qualify as a rapidly intensifying system<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The storm’s core was located approximately 110 to 120 miles south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, moving at a dangerously slow pace of just three to five miles per hour<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. This sluggish forward speed is a critical factor, as it significantly increases the duration of the storm’s impact, allowing it to dump massive amounts of rainfall over the same areas for an extended period<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The NHC’s forecast track projects that the core of Melissa will move near or directly over Jamaica through Tuesday, with landfall expected late Monday night or early Tuesday morning<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Should it strike at its predicted strength, Melissa would surpass Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 to become the most powerful hurricane to make landfall on the island in modern history<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Deluge and the Surge</h2>
           <p>The primary threat posed by Hurricane Melissa is not solely its destructive wind field, but the catastrophic flooding and landslides expected from the torrential rain<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Forecasts indicate that the slow-moving system is expected to drop between 15 and 30 inches of rain on Jamaica, with localised totals in some areas potentially reaching up to 40 inches<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The island’s mountainous terrain will exacerbate this deluge, forcing the air to rise and creating even more rain, which will then cascade down steep slopes, creating ideal conditions for devastating mudslides<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The NHC has explicitly stated that catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of Jamaica and southern Hispaniola<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Beyond the rainfall, a life-threatening storm surge is a major concern for Jamaica’s southern coast, including the area near the capital city of Kingston<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Peak storm surge heights are forecast to reach between nine and thirteen feet above ground level near and to the east of the landfall point, a surge that will be accompanied by large and destructive waves<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The combination of destructive winds, historic rainfall, and a massive storm surge is expected to cause extensive infrastructural damage, long-duration power and communication outages, and the isolation of entire communities<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>National Mobilisation and Evacuation</h2>
           <p>In anticipation of the storm’s arrival, Jamaican authorities have initiated a full-scale national emergency response<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The entire island is under a hurricane warning, signifying that hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) has activated its National Emergency Operation Centre at a high alert level, which corresponds to a Level 3, or full response phase, involving the mobilisation of all first responders and supporting agencies<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Over 650 emergency shelters have been activated across the island to accommodate residents in flood-prone and vulnerable areas<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. Officials have urged residents to complete all preparations immediately, heed official warnings, and avoid unnecessary travel during the storm<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The government has also taken steps to secure essential services, with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) activating its command centres and placing overseas line crews on standby<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The JPS has intensified vegetation management and grid reinforcement, particularly in key transmission areas, and equipped critical control and telecommunications sites with 48-hour backup power and Starlink systems to ensure communication continuity<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Transportation across the island has been severely curtailed, with the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston closing at 8 p.m. local time on Saturday, and the Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay closing at noon local time on Sunday<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. Tourists have been rushing to leave the island ahead of the airport closures<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Regional Devastation and Path</h2>
           <p>The destructive reach of Hurricane Melissa extends beyond Jamaica, with significant impacts already felt across the wider Caribbean<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The storm’s outer rainbands have already caused devastation in Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. In Haiti, at least three people have died, and another five were injured due to a collapsed wall, with authorities reporting catastrophic flash flooding and landslides, particularly in the Tiburon Peninsula<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. The United Nations has allocated $4 million in humanitarian aid to support evacuation and emergency response efforts in Haiti<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The Dominican Republic has also reported one death and one person missing, alongside significant damage to nearly 200 homes<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. Flooding has isolated over two dozen communities in the Dominican Republic, and numerous water supply systems are out of service, affecting more than half a million customers<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings remain in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, from the Dominican Republic border to Port-au-Prince<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Following its passage over Jamaica, the hurricane is forecast to move across southeastern Cuba by Tuesday night, where hurricane watches are in effect for several provinces, including Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo, and Holguín<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The US Navy has ordered the evacuation of non-essential personnel and their families from the base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The storm is then expected to track toward the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands by Wednesday<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The slow, relentless approach of Hurricane Melissa presents an existential threat to Jamaica and a major humanitarian challenge for the entire northern Caribbean<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The combination of the storm’s extreme intensity, its potential to reach Category 5 status, and its unusually slow forward speed creates a scenario for a prolonged and devastating disaster<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. As the island nation prepares for what could be the most powerful storm in its recorded history, the focus remains on the immediate priority of safeguarding human life against the imminent threats of catastrophic flooding, landslides, and a life-threatening storm surge<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The regional impact, already evident in the fatalities and infrastructure damage across Hispaniola, underscores the widespread nature of the unfolding crisis<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>.</p>
