            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The assassination of the American conservative activist Charlie Kirk on 10 September 2025 has precipitated a significant and multifaceted political response. Domestically, his death is being leveraged by allies of President Donald Trump to construct a narrative of martyrdom, fuelling a crackdown on political dissent and inspiring legislative efforts to memorialise his legacy. A notable example is a proposed law in Florida that would compel state universities to rename campus roads in his honour, threatening financial penalties for non-compliance. Internationally, Kirk's death has been instrumentalised for distinct political ends. In Lima, Peru, Mayor Rafael López Aliaga, a conservative presidential aspirant, organised a large-scale public memorial for Kirk. This event was strategically employed to consolidate his own conservative base, composed of evangelical and Catholic groups, and to signal his alignment with the Trump administration in the United States, thereby seeking to bolster his political standing. The aftermath of Kirk's death demonstrates the potent and transnational application of a political figure's legacy as a tool for advancing specific, and often controversial, political agendas.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>On 10 September 2025, the American conservative political landscape was irrevocably altered. Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) and a prominent, often polarising, voice of the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) movement, was shot and killed while conducting a public debate at Utah Valley University  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The act, which President Donald Trump immediately labelled a "political assassination," sent shockwaves through the United States, triggering not only widespread condemnation of political violence but also a complex and calculated series of political manoeuvres  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. In the weeks following his death, Kirk's legacy has become a powerful political instrument. Within the United States, his allies have begun to fashion a narrative of martyrdom, using his death to justify intensified attacks on their political opponents and to propose legislation aimed at cementing his place in the public consciousness  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. Simultaneously, the reverberations of his death have extended far beyond American borders, most notably to Lima, Peru. There, the city's conservative mayor, Rafael López Aliaga, has seized upon Kirk's death as an opportunity to rally his own base and publicly align himself with the influential political forces in Washington D.C.  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. The instrumentalisation of Kirk's death, both at home and abroad, provides a compelling case study in how the memory of a political figure can be rapidly and strategically repurposed to serve contemporary political ambitions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>The Rise of a Conservative Firebrand</h3>
            <p>To comprehend the political gravity of Charlie Kirk's death, one must first understand the scale of the political enterprise he constructed during his lifetime. Born on 14 October 1993, in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, Kirk eschewed a traditional university education, opting instead to dive directly into political activism after a brief stint at a community college  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. In 2012, at the age of just 18, he co-founded Turning Point USA with the late Bill Montgomery  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. Kirk's vision was to create a dynamic and youth-focused organisation that would advocate for free markets, limited government, and conservative values on American high school and university campuses, which he often described as "islands of totalitarianism" and "leftist echo chambers"  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The organisation's initial funding came from a chance encounter at the 2012 Republican National Convention, where Kirk persuaded Foster Friess, a prominent Republican donor, to provide the seed money  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. From this modest start, TPUSA grew into a financial behemoth of the American right. By 2023, the organisation reported revenues of approximately $82 million, sourced from a network of wealthy conservative donors and foundations, including the Ed Uihlein Family Foundation and donors connected to the Koch network  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>. This financial power enabled a vast expansion of its activities and influence.</p>
            <p>TPUSA's strategy was multifaceted and aggressive. It established a presence on thousands of school and university campuses, with paid staff tasked with recruiting students and promoting conservative ideas through slickly branded events and materials  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. One of its most controversial initiatives was the "Professor Watchlist," a website launched in 2016 that listed academics whom TPUSA accused of discriminating against conservative students and promoting "leftist propaganda"  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. Critics argued the watchlist was a tool for harassment and intimidation, often containing inaccuracies and targeting professors for their scholarly work or social media posts  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. The organisation also sought to influence student government elections, providing financial support to conservative candidates with the stated goal of defunding progressive campus groups and promoting a "message of American Exceptionalism"  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Kirk's personal profile grew in tandem with his organisation's. He became a charismatic and relentless public speaker, known for his "Prove Me Wrong" events on campuses where he would debate students on contentious political issues  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. His media presence was substantial; he hosted "The Charlie Kirk Show," a popular podcast and radio programme, and was a frequent guest on conservative news outlets  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. His rhetoric was often incendiary. He was a vocal proponent of President Trump's false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 election and promoted conspiracy theories such as the "Great Replacement," which posits that white Americans are being deliberately replaced by immigrants  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>. He espoused deeply conservative social views, opposing abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, and advocating for traditional gender roles, at one point encouraging young women to pursue a "Mrs. degree" in college  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The symbiotic relationship between Charlie Kirk and Donald Trump was central to the rise of both. Kirk became an early and ardent supporter of Trump, and TPUSA effectively functioned as the youth wing of the MAGA movement  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. In 2019, Kirk's 501(c)(4) political advocacy arm, Turning Point Action, acquired "Students for Trump"  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. This arm of his organisation focused on direct political action, including the "Chase The Vote" initiative in 2024, a multi-million dollar get-out-the-vote effort in key swing states that was credited with helping Trump secure victory  <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a></sup>. Trump, in turn, frequently appeared at TPUSA events, heaping praise on Kirk and recognising his effectiveness in mobilising young voters  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. Vice President JD Vance noted that Kirk not only helped the administration win the 2024 election but was also instrumental in staffing the government  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>. This deep integration with the highest levels of power made Kirk one of the most influential political activists in the nation, transforming him from a campus provocateur into a central figure in the governing conservative movement  <sup><a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. It was this influence that made his sudden death not just a personal tragedy, but a political event of the first order.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>An American Martyrdom: The Domestic Political Aftermath</h3>
            <p>The response from the Trump administration and its allies to Kirk's assassination was immediate and unequivocal: he was to be framed as a martyr for the conservative cause. In a video address from the Oval Office on the evening of the shooting, President Trump declared Kirk "a martyr for truth and freedom," explicitly blaming the "radical left" for creating a climate of demonisation that he claimed was "directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today"  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. This set the tone for a political strategy that sought to transmute grief into grievance and political capital. The administration announced that Kirk would posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honour  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This narrative of martyrdom was the centrepiece of a massive memorial service held in Glendale, Arizona, which blended the aesthetics of a political rally with a religious revival  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. Supporters packed the Arizona Cardinals' stadium, where speaker after speaker, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, portrayed Kirk as a figure of near-biblical importance who had confronted evil and proclaimed the truth  <sup><a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>. The event was designed to galvanise the conservative movement, positioning Kirk's death as proof of the left's perfidy and a justification for an even more aggressive political posture  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This posture quickly translated into concrete action. The Trump administration vowed a broad crackdown on what it termed "radical left political violence," promising to find "each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity... including the organizations that fund it and support it"  <sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. This was accompanied by a wave of disciplinary actions against individuals who made comments online that were perceived as celebrating or trivialising Kirk's death  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. The Department of State announced it would penalise individuals for such comments, and the Secretary of Defense launched an investigation into the reactions of military personnel  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. This created a chilling effect, with critics arguing that the administration was opportunistically using Kirk's death to target political enemies and suppress dissent  <sup><a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The effort to memorialise Kirk and leverage his death also extended to state-level politics, most notably in Florida. Within weeks of the assassination, Republican state lawmakers filed multiple bills to rename roads in his honour. State Representative Juan Carlos Porras, who co-founded the first TPUSA chapter in Florida with Kirk at Florida International University (FIU), filed House Bill 33 to designate a stretch of road in front of the FIU campus as "Charlie Kirk Memorial Avenue"  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a></sup>. Porras stated the renaming would "honor his legacy" where their activism began  <sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>A more sweeping and coercive proposal came from State Representative Kevin Steele. His legislation, House Bill 113, would mandate that nearly 40 state universities and colleges across Florida rename a designated campus road after Charlie Kirk  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. The bill included a punitive clause: any institution whose board of trustees failed to make the change within 90 days would have its state funding withheld  <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></sup>. This proposal would see prominent roads like Stadium Road at the University of Florida and Gemini Boulevard South at the University of Central Florida become "Charlie James Kirk Road" and "Charlie James Kirk Blvd." respectively  <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>These legislative efforts were not without controversy. In Lake County, Florida, a proposal by County Commissioner Anthony Sabatini to rename a road as the "Charlie Kirk Memorial Highway" sparked a heated public meeting  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a></sup>. Many residents argued against the proposal, suggesting it would be more appropriate to honour local figures like fallen law enforcement officers  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. The debate descended into shouting and profanity, with Sabatini calling one opponent a "disgusting person"  <sup><a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></sup>. Despite the public opposition, the commission ultimately approved the renaming unanimously  <sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup>. These events in Florida illustrate a clear strategy: to use the power of the state to physically embed the memory and martyrdom of Charlie Kirk into the public landscape, transforming university campuses and public highways into monuments to a fallen icon of the MAGA movement.</p>

            <h3>The Echo in the Andes: A Memorial in Lima and the Quest for Influence</h3>
            <p>The political instrumentalisation of Charlie Kirk's death was not confined to the United States. Thousands of miles to the south, in Lima, Peru, the activist's demise became a strategic opportunity for one of the country's most prominent conservative figures, Mayor Rafael López Aliaga. Known by the nickname "Porky," López Aliaga is a businessman, a member of the conservative Catholic organisation Opus Dei, and the leader of the right-wing Popular Renewal party who harbours ambitions for the Peruvian presidency  <sup><a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>On 4 and 5 October 2025, less than a month after Kirk's death, López Aliaga staged a large public tribute to him in a central Lima park, the Circuito Mágico del Agua  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. The event, titled "Tribute to Charlie Kirk and the defense of life and liberty," featured dance performances and water projections and was attended by hundreds of people, including members of evangelical and Christian churches, local politicians, and sympathisers of the Trump movement in the US  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>. López Aliaga declared the day a "fiesta" and not a day of mourning, casting Kirk as a martyr in the same vein as early Christians who died for their faith  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The mayor's rhetoric at the event was explicitly political and ideological. He used the platform to launch a broadside against his political opponents, calling for a united front to "combat this left of evil"  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. He framed the political struggle in Peru as part of a larger, transnational conflict, stating, "We are under attack, just like the United States, Colombia and Ecuador, by a green wave that attacks life and by South American narco-dictatorships that want to impose their authoritarian model"  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup>. By honouring Kirk, López Aliaga was strategically positioning himself as the leader of this conservative counter-offensive in Peru. He highlighted that Kirk, an evangelical Christian whose wife is Catholic, was a "synthesis" and a symbol of the unity needed to defeat the left  <sup><a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The motivation behind this elaborate and seemingly incongruous tribute to a foreign activist was twofold. First, it served a domestic political purpose. López Aliaga, who won the Lima mayorship in 2022 with a relatively small plurality of the vote, used the event to consolidate his conservative base, uniting the often-separate constituencies of right-wing Catholics and the growing evangelical movement in Peru  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a></sup>. The event was a clear demonstration of his leadership of the country's socially conservative forces, built on shared opposition to abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and leftist politics  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Second, and perhaps more significantly, the tribute was an act of political signalling directed at the United States. López Aliaga has actively sought to cultivate ties with Donald Trump's political circle  <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a></sup>. He was one of the first Peruvian politicians to congratulate Trump on his 2024 election victory and has attended conservative political conferences in the US  <sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. According to a New York Times report, the memorial for Kirk was held as the mayor "sought help from the Trump administration"  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>. By organising a high-profile event honouring a figure so closely associated with President Trump, López Aliaga was making a conspicuous effort to curry favour with the dominant power in the Republican Party. This move was interpreted by Peruvian political analysts as part of his broader electoral strategy for the 2026 presidential election, seeking to secure the backing and potential financing of influential right-wing networks in the United States  <sup><a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref24">24</a></sup>. The tribute was met with criticism within Peru, with many questioning the use of public resources to honour a controversial foreign figure who held negative views on Latin American immigration and was largely unknown to the general Peruvian population  <sup><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. Nevertheless, the event in Lima starkly demonstrated how the death of an American political activist could be repurposed in a different national context to serve the specific ambitions of a local political leader aiming to build both a domestic coalition and a powerful international alliance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The Future of a Movement Without its Face</h3>
            <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has created a significant power vacuum at the heart of the American conservative youth movement. For over a decade, his identity and that of Turning Point USA were inextricably linked. He was not just its founder and executive director; he was its chief fundraiser, its most recognisable public face, and its primary ideological driver  <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>. His death raises fundamental questions about the future trajectory of the multi-million dollar organisation he built and the broader MAGA movement he helped to energise.</p>
            <p>In the immediate aftermath, the leadership of TPUSA moved swiftly to ensure continuity. On 18 September 2025, the organisation's board announced that Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, would assume leadership of the organisation, a move said to be in accordance with her late husband's wishes  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a></sup>. This decision provides a semblance of stability, keeping control within the family and signalling a commitment to continue Kirk's mission. The outpouring of support following his death, including a surge in donations, suggests that the organisation will not face any immediate financial crisis  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. Furthermore, some local chapters reported a significant increase in interest and membership, as his death appeared to galvanise some young conservatives who now saw the organisation's work as more important than ever  <sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>However, the long-term challenge will be to replace Kirk's unique and potent brand of charismatic leadership. His particular talent lay in his ability to translate traditional conservative ideas into a modern, social media-savvy vernacular that resonated with a younger audience  <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a></sup>. He thrived in confrontational campus debates and had a knack for creating viral moments that fuelled the culture wars. While TPUSA has cultivated other influencers and media personalities, none possess the same level of name recognition or the deep, personal connection to President Trump that Kirk enjoyed  <sup><a href="#ref11">11</a></sup>. His role as a bridge between the conservative donor class, the grassroots youth movement, and the White House will be difficult to replicate  <sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>The broader political movement faces a different calculation. While it has lost a uniquely effective organiser and communicator, it has gained a martyr. The political right in the United States has a long history of transforming its fallen figures into powerful symbols, using their memory to fuel grievance and mobilise its base  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The narrative of Kirk as a "great warrior" slain by the forces of left-wing hatred is a potent tool  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></sup>. It serves to validate the worldview that conservatives are a persecuted group under constant attack, thereby justifying more extreme political measures in the name of security and retribution  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>This dynamic suggests that Kirk's influence may not wane in his absence; rather, it may be transformed. In life, he was a controversial and divisive figure, even within some conservative circles. In death, his legacy can be sanitised and idealised, his more controversial statements downplayed in favour of a simplified narrative of heroic sacrifice  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. This idealised version of Charlie Kirk can be invoked to support a wide range of political goals, from specific legislation like the Florida road-naming bills to the broader objectives of Project 2025, a conservative initiative to reshape the federal government with which Kirk was involved  <sup><a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref20">20</a></sup>. The danger, as some commentators have noted, is that his assassination will be used to justify harsher crackdowns on dissent and a more authoritarian approach to politics, all in the name of honouring his memory  <sup><a href="#ref17">17</a></sup>. The future of the movement Kirk led will depend on whether any new leader can effectively channel the energy he generated, and on how successfully the political apparatus around President Trump can wield the powerful new symbol of his martyrdom.</p>

            <p>The death of Charlie Kirk on 10 September 2025 marked the end of a significant chapter in American conservative politics, but it simultaneously opened a new one, characterised by the strategic manipulation of his legacy. The aftermath has demonstrated with stark clarity how the memory of a single individual can be rapidly and effectively instrumentalised to serve diverse and pre-existing political agendas across different geographical and political contexts.</p>
            <p>In the United States, Kirk's allies have wasted no time in constructing a potent narrative of martyrdom. This narrative serves not only to lionise a fallen leader but also to fuel a political strategy of grievance and retribution. It provides a powerful justification for a crackdown on political opponents and underpins legislative efforts, such as the controversial bills in Florida, to physically and permanently inscribe his memory onto the public landscape. The transformation of Charlie Kirk from a political activist into an official symbol of the MAGA movement is a calculated effort to ensure his influence endures far beyond his lifetime, serving as a perpetual rallying cry for the cause he championed.</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, the tribute organised by Mayor Rafael López Aliaga in Lima reveals the transnational utility of such a potent symbol. By honouring Kirk, López Aliaga sought to achieve parallel goals: consolidating his own socially conservative base within Peru and broadcasting his allegiance to the powerful Trump administration in the United States. This act of political appropriation highlights the interconnected nature of contemporary right-wing movements, where symbols and narratives can be borrowed and repurposed to bolster local ambitions and forge international alliances.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the political use of Charlie Kirk's death underscores a broader phenomenon in modern politics. In an era of intense polarisation and ideological conflict, the death of a prominent figure is rarely allowed to be a simple tragedy. Instead, it becomes a resource, a narrative to be shaped, and a weapon to be wielded. The legacy of Charlie Kirk, now in the hands of his political heirs, is being actively forged into a tool for shaping the future of conservative politics, not only in America but also for those abroad who seek to align themselves with its power.</p>
