            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The commissioning of the Fujian, China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, marks a pivotal moment in the nation's ambitious naval expansion. Entering service on 5 November 2025, the vessel represents a significant technological leap, featuring an electromagnetic catapult system previously only operational on the newest American carriers. This allows for the launch of heavier, more capable aircraft, fundamentally altering the potential reach and power of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). While the Fujian still relies on conventional propulsion, unlike its nuclear-powered US counterparts, its introduction signals a clear intent to challenge long-standing American maritime dominance in the Indo-Pacific. The vessel is a core component of President Xi Jinping's goal to build a 'world-class' military, capable of projecting power far beyond China's immediate shores. Its deployment is set to intensify strategic competition in contested waters like the South China Sea and around Taiwan, compelling regional powers and the United States to reassess the shifting balance of naval strength.</p>

           <h2>A New Era on the High Seas</h2>
           <p>On 5 November 2025, China's third and most technologically advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, officially entered active service.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> The commissioning ceremony, held at the Sanya naval base on Hainan island, was attended by President Xi Jinping, a clear signal of the vessel's strategic importance in the nation's military modernisation.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> The Fujian, named after the coastal province opposite Taiwan, represents a significant milestone in the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) ambition to transform into a 'blue water' force, capable of projecting power far beyond its own shores.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> This development is a key element of Xi's long-running effort to overhaul the Chinese military, with the stated goal of creating a 'world-class' force by the middle of the century.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> The vessel's entry into service places China second only to the United States in the number of active aircraft carriers, ahead of the United Kingdom, India, and Italy, who each operate two.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> The United States Navy currently maintains a fleet of eleven carriers.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup></p>

           <h2>From Soviet Hulls to Indigenous Supercarriers</h2>
           <p>China's journey to becoming a carrier power has been a long and methodical process.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> The ambition dates back decades, with early efforts focused on acquiring and studying retired foreign vessels.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup> In 1985, China acquired the decommissioned Australian aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, which provided invaluable insights into carrier construction and operation.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup> This was followed by the purchase of three ex-Soviet vessels, the Minsk, the Kiev, and, most importantly, the unfinished Kuznetsov-class carrier Varyag.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup> After an extensive refit, the Varyag was commissioned in September 2012 as the Liaoning, China's first operational aircraft carrier.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> The experience gained from the Liaoning project was foundational, leading to the construction of China's first domestically produced carrier, the Shandong.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> Launched in 2017 and commissioned in 2019, the Shandong was largely based on the Liaoning's Soviet design, featuring a ski-jump ramp for launching aircraft.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> The Fujian, however, is a departure from these earlier efforts.<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> It is China's first carrier to be wholly designed and built indigenously, representing a new generation of naval capability.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> Construction began at Shanghai's Jiangnan Shipyard in 2017, and the vessel was launched in June 2022.<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup> The period from its launch to commissioning involved numerous sea trials, beginning in May 2024, to test its systems and performance.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Technological Leap Forward</h2>
           <p>The most significant advancement of the Fujian is its aircraft launch system.<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup> Unlike the Liaoning and Shandong, which use a Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) system with a ski-jump ramp, the Fujian employs a Catapult-Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration.<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> Crucially, it has leapfrogged steam-powered catapults, a technology used on most US carriers, and is equipped with an advanced electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS).<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> This makes China only the second country in the world, after the United States, to operate a carrier with this technology, which is currently found only on the latest Ford-class carriers.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> The electromagnetic system offers several advantages over older technologies.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> It allows for more precise control over launch speed, causes less stress on aircraft airframes, and can launch a wider variety of aircraft, from lightweight drones to heavier, fully-loaded warplanes.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> This capability is critical for deploying larger support aircraft, such as the KJ-600 airborne early warning and control plane, which cannot be launched from a ski-jump.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> The ability to launch these heavier aircraft extends the carrier's operational reach, as it no longer has to rely solely on land-based reconnaissance to detect threats.<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> Chinese state media has reported that the Fujian's EMALS, which uses a medium-voltage direct current system, is more reliable than the alternating current system on the USS Gerald R. Ford.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> Reports also suggest the Fujian can achieve higher launch rates than US Nimitz-class carriers.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> During trials, the Fujian successfully launched several aircraft types, including the new J-35 stealth fighter, the J-15T heavy fighter, and the KJ-600, demonstrating its full-deck operational capability.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup></p>

           <h2>Dimensions of Power</h2>
           <p>With a full-load displacement of over 80,000 tonnes and a length of 316 metres, the Fujian is the largest warship ever built by an Asian nation.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup> While significantly larger than its predecessors, the Liaoning and Shandong, and European carriers like the UK's HMS Queen Elizabeth, it remains smaller than the American Nimitz and Ford-class supercarriers, which displace over 100,000 tonnes.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The Fujian's air wing is estimated to be between 40 and 60 aircraft, slightly less than the 60 to 70 planes carried by its US counterparts.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> A key distinction, however, lies in its propulsion.<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup> The Fujian is conventionally powered by steam turbines, which limits its operational range and endurance compared to the nuclear-powered fleets of the United States and France.<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup> Nuclear-powered carriers have virtually unlimited range and do not require frequent refuelling, a significant logistical constraint for conventionally powered vessels operating far from home ports.<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup> China is reportedly working on developing nuclear propulsion for a future fourth carrier, which would represent another major step in its naval ambitions.<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Shifting Tides in the Indo-Pacific</h2>
           <p>The commissioning of the Fujian is a clear statement of China's intent to reshape the strategic landscape of the Indo-Pacific.<sup><a href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> For decades, the region's waters have been dominated by the US Navy.<sup><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> China's rapidly expanding naval power, now spearheaded by a third, highly capable carrier, directly challenges this status quo.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world's largest by number of ships, and the Fujian adds a new dimension of power projection to this fleet.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> The carrier's primary strategic value lies in its ability to extend China's defensive perimeter and operational reach.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> Chinese naval strategy has evolved from a focus on 'near seas defence' to include 'far seas protection', safeguarding the nation's growing global interests, including vital sea lines of communication.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup> An operational three-carrier force would allow the PLAN to maintain a persistent presence in key areas, theoretically enabling one carrier to be on patrol, one in training, and one undergoing maintenance.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> This enhanced capability is particularly significant in the context of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its stance on Taiwan.<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> A carrier strike group led by the Fujian could be used to enforce these claims, intimidate regional rivals, and complicate any potential US military intervention in a conflict over Taiwan.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup> The development has been met with concern by regional powers.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> Japan has warned that China is rapidly strengthening its military power without transparency, while other nations in the region are also bolstering their own naval capabilities in response.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Long Voyage Ahead</h2>
           <p>Despite the Fujian's impressive technological advancements, China faces significant hurdles in becoming a truly global carrier power.<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> The most substantial of these is a lack of operational experience.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> The US Navy has over a century of experience in complex carrier operations, including sustained 24-hour flight cycles, night landings, and operations in adverse weather conditions.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> These are skills that can only be developed over time through rigorous training and real-world deployments.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> Furthermore, operating a carrier strike group effectively requires a sophisticated ecosystem of support vessels, including guided-missile cruisers, destroyers, and submarines for protection, particularly against submarine and missile threats.<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> While China's shipbuilding industry is working at an unrivalled pace, analysts note that the PLAN is still developing its proficiency in these crucial protective screening operations.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> The reliance on conventional power also remains a key limitation for blue-water operations far from China's shores.<sup><a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup> Without a global network of naval bases comparable to that of the United States, long-range deployments will depend heavily on a vulnerable chain of replenishment ships.<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup> Nevertheless, the Fujian's entry into service is a transformative event.<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup> It provides the PLAN with a platform to develop the doctrines, train the personnel, and gain the experience necessary for modern carrier operations, setting the standard for a future fleet that may one day include nuclear-powered supercarriers.<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The commissioning of the Fujian is more than the launch of a single ship; it is a potent symbol of a shifting global power dynamic.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup> It embodies China's ambition to become a premier maritime power, capable of defending its interests and projecting influence across the Indo-Pacific and beyond.<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> The vessel's advanced electromagnetic catapults represent a significant narrowing of the technological gap with the United States, enabling China to deploy a more formidable and versatile carrier air wing.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> While the PLAN still faces a long and challenging journey to match the experience and global reach of the US Navy, the rapid pace of its modernisation cannot be ignored.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup> The Fujian's steel deck is the new stage upon which the strategic competition of the 21st century will increasingly be played out, forcing a recalculation of naval power in a region of critical importance to global stability and trade.<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup> The dragon's tide is rising, and the waters of the Pacific are unlikely to remain calm.</p>
