            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A new, urgent independent investigation has been ordered into the repeated and systemic maternity and neonatal care failures at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. This decision, described by ministers as an 'exceptional step'<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, follows years of relentless campaigning by bereaved families who have sought accountability for the deaths and injuries of their children<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The inquiry will focus on the trust's two main hospitals, Leeds General Infirmary and St James's University Hospital<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, which were recently downgraded to an 'inadequate' safety rating by the Care Quality Commission<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The move highlights the deep-seated cultural and clinical problems within one of England's largest teaching trusts, where internal reviews had previously identified dozens of potentially preventable baby deaths<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.</p>

            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>The trust was rated "red" for seven years for high death rates.</li>
               <li>£71 million was paid out in compensation between April 2015 and April 2024.</li>
               <li>The CQC downgraded the safety rating to "inadequate" in June 2025.</li>
               <li>Daughter Aliona Winser-Ramm died in 2020; an inquest found "gross failures".</li>
               <li>107 clinical claims were made against LTHT from April 2015 to April 2024.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recent Findings</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>A BBC investigation found 56 babies and two mothers may have died preventably.</li>
               <li>The 56 baby deaths comprised 27 stillbirths and 29 neonatal deaths.</li>
               <li>The 2022 neonatal mortality rate was 4.46 per 1,000 live births.</li>
               <li>This mortality rate was 70 per cent higher than the average for comparable trusts.</li>
               <li>The CQC identified a deep-rooted "blame culture" within the trust.</li>

           <h2>The Campaign for Accountability</h2>
           <p>The announcement of a dedicated, independent investigation into the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) maternity services marks a significant victory for the families who have spent years fighting for answers<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Health Secretary Wes Streeting ordered the urgent inquiry in October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>, taking what his department called an 'exceptional step' to address the scale of the failings<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The decision came after Mr Streeting met with members of the Leeds Hospitals Maternity Family Support Group<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>, a collective of parents whose children were either harmed or died due to what they allege was poor care<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The Health Secretary stated he was 'shocked' by the families' experiences of 'repeated maternity failures' and the 'unacceptable response of the trust'<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.<br><br>Among the most prominent campaigners are Fiona Winser-Ramm and Daniel Ramm, whose daughter Aliona Winser-Ramm died in 2020<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. An inquest into Aliona’s death found that a number of 'gross failures of the most basic nature' had occurred<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Another key figure is Lauren Caulfield, whose daughter Grace was stillborn in 2022 at Leeds General Infirmary<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Ms Caulfield described feeling 'dismissed and gaslit' by the trust following her experience<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The support group, which is approximately 150-strong<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>, includes families who have experienced the death of a baby or mother, serious injury, or a serious near-miss<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. In a powerful demonstration in September 2025, the group presented Mr Streeting with a ten-metre-long washing line holding 56 babygrows and two adult-sized t-shirts, symbolising the potentially avoidable deaths identified in a BBC investigation<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The families had initially called for a full statutory public inquiry, which would have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. While the new investigation is independent, it does not possess the same statutory powers<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The campaigners have also publicly called for former midwife Donna Ockenden, who led the reviews into the Shrewsbury and Telford and Nottingham maternity scandals, to chair the Leeds inquiry<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Scale of Avoidable Harm</h2>
           <p>The decision to launch a dedicated inquiry was precipitated by a series of damning revelations concerning the safety record of the LTHT maternity units. A BBC investigation, published in early 2025, brought the scale of the tragedy into sharp focus<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The investigation found that between January 2019 and July 2024, the deaths of at least 56 babies and two mothers may have been preventable<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The baby deaths comprised 27 stillbirths and 29 neonatal deaths, which are defined as deaths occurring within 28 days after birth<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The trust’s own internal review group had identified care issues in each of these cases that it considered may have made a difference to the outcome for the babies<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>.<br><br>Further data underscored the severity of the situation. According to the latest report by MBRRACE-UK, the trust recorded the highest neonatal mortality rate in the UK in 2022<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The rate stood at 4.46 per 1,000 live births, a figure 70 per cent higher than the average for comparable NHS trusts<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The trust has been rated 'red'—indicating death rates at least five per cent higher than average—for every one of the seven years that this data has been collected<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Beyond the tragic loss of life, a Freedom of Information request to NHS Resolution revealed that 107 clinical claims for obstetric-related deaths and injuries were made against LTHT between April 2015 and April 2024<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. During this period, over £71 million was paid out in compensation<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The trust was also forced to repay nearly £5 million in funds it had claimed under the Maternity Incentive Scheme after it was found to have wrongly asserted that it met safe standards of care and staffing<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Culture of Blame and Systemic Failure</h2>
           <p>The systemic nature of the failings was officially confirmed in June 2025 when the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the independent health regulator, downgraded the safety rating of maternity services at both Leeds General Infirmary and St James's University Hospital to 'inadequate'<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. This rating was a significant drop from the previous 'good' rating<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The CQC’s unannounced inspections, conducted in December 2024 and January 2025<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, substantiated concerns raised by staff, patients, and families<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The regulator found that the care provided posed a 'significant risk' to the safety of women and babies<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.<br><br>The CQC report detailed a number of critical breaches in official regulations. These included issues with risk management, infection control, and the unsafe storage of medicines<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Inspectors also found dirty areas on the maternity wards of both hospitals<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Crucially, the CQC identified a deep-rooted 'blame culture' within the trust<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. This culture meant that staff were reluctant to raise concerns or report incidents, which directly impacted the trust's ability to learn from mistakes and improve safety<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Whistleblowers, including senior staff, had previously warned that the previous 'good' CQC rating did not accurately reflect the reality of the units<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. They described chronic understaffing, low levels of care, and a workplace where concerns were often ignored or 'swept under the carpet'<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The CQC also noted that staff shortages impacted the timeliness of care and support<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Neonatal services at both hospitals were also found to 'require improvement'<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, with inspectors noting that infants needing special care were sometimes transported unsafely between the two hospitals<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The trust was placed under the Maternity Safety Support Programme, a national intervention for the most concerning maternity units, following a March 2025 inspection by NHS England that resulted in 101 urgent recommendations<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A National Crisis in Maternity Care</h2>
           <p>The crisis in Leeds is not an isolated incident but the latest in a series of high-profile maternity scandals that have emerged across the National Health Service<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The failings at LTHT echo those found in other trusts, including Shrewsbury and Telford, Morecambe Bay, East Kent, and Nottingham<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The common threads across these reviews often include women's voices being ignored, safety concerns being overlooked, and poor leadership fostering toxic cultures<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, had previously announced a 'rapid' national investigation into NHS maternity and neonatal services in England in June 2025<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. This national review, chaired by Baroness Amos<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, was intended to urgently look at up to ten of the worst-performing trusts, including Leeds<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. However, families in Leeds argued that the speed and scale of this national exercise would not 'scratch the surface' of the front-line care failings at their local trust<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The decision to launch a separate, dedicated inquiry for Leeds was a direct response to the campaigners' insistence that the problems were 'way beyond what a national maternity investigation will be able to achieve'<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The new, urgent inquiry is intended to provide the families with the 'honesty and accountability they deserve' and to 'end the normalisation of deaths of women and babies in maternity units'<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The terms of reference for the Leeds inquiry are expected to be modelled on those used for the Nottingham review<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, and the investigation will run in parallel with the national review<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The launch of an independent inquiry into the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust represents a critical moment in the ongoing national effort to address systemic failures in maternity care<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The trust, which runs one of Europe's largest teaching hospitals<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, has been exposed as an 'outlier' on perinatal mortality<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, with a culture of blame and chronic understaffing contributing to dozens of potentially avoidable deaths over a five-year period<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The inquiry, secured through the tireless advocacy of bereaved families, is an acknowledgement that the trust's internal responses and the initial national review were insufficient to address the deep-seated problems<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The challenge now lies in ensuring the investigation, which is not a full statutory public inquiry<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, has the necessary scope and independence to deliver the truth and accountability that the families have been denied for years<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The ultimate measure of its success will be its ability to finally break the 'cycle of repeated errors and inadequate leadership'<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> and implement lasting, on-the-ground changes to prevent further tragedies in Leeds and across the wider NHS<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
