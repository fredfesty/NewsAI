            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The meeting between the American President and the Hungarian Prime Minister in Washington on 7 November 2025 was more than a routine diplomatic engagement; it was a stark illustration of the shifting tectonic plates in transatlantic relations. At its heart, the discussion centred on a request from Budapest for an exemption from American sanctions targeting Russia's energy sector, a plea necessitated by Hungary's deep reliance on Russian oil and gas. The White House appeared sympathetic, citing Hungary's landlocked geography as a practical impediment to diversification. This concession, however, served as the backdrop for a much broader convergence of interests. The two leaders, long united by a shared ideological outlook, also discussed the war in Ukraine, with the Hungarian leader positioning himself as a key peacemaker and potential host for a summit between the American and Russian presidents. The warm reception for a leader who has consistently challenged the European Union's consensus on Russia, Ukraine, and the rule of law sends a powerful signal. It highlights a growing alignment between the American administration's 'America First' foreign policy and the 'illiberal democracy' championed by Budapest, creating new fault lines within the Western alliance and raising profound questions about its future cohesion and its collective stance towards Moscow.</p>

           <h2>An Exemption in Washington</h2>
           <p>On 7 November 2025, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán arrived at the White House for his first bilateral meeting with President Donald Trump since the American leader returned to office.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> The primary objective of the visit was unambiguous: to secure a reprieve for Hungary from the weight of American sanctions imposed on Russia's energy sector.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup> In late October, the Trump administration had targeted Russian energy giants Lukoil and Rosneft, a move that threatened to penalise foreign entities continuing to do business with them.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> For Hungary, a nation deeply enmeshed in Russia's energy infrastructure, the sanctions posed a significant economic threat.<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup><br><br>Orbán had made his intentions clear before the meeting, framing the issue as one of national survival.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> He argued that Hungary's landlocked geography and its reliance on pipelines constructed during the Soviet era, specifically the Druzhba pipeline, made continued access to Russian oil a matter of physical reality, not political choice.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> During public remarks alongside President Trump, Orbán reiterated this point, stating that pipelines are not an ideological issue but a vital necessity for his country, which lacks seaports for alternative energy imports.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup><br><br>President Trump appeared receptive to this argument.<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> He publicly acknowledged the geographical constraints faced by Hungary, noting that it is very difficult for the country to acquire oil and gas from other areas because it does not have the advantage of the sea.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> While criticising other European nations for purchasing Russian energy despite having viable alternatives, Trump signalled a willingness to consider Budapest's unique position.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup> He told the media he was "looking at" granting Hungary an exception.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup><br><br>Following the discussions, the Hungarian leader announced a successful outcome.<sup><a href="#ref-39">39</a></sup> Orbán stated that Hungary had received a full sanctions exemption for the TurkStream and Druzhba pipelines, which deliver Russian gas and oil respectively.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> The meeting also yielded other agreements, underscoring a deepening of bilateral ties.<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced plans for a significant nuclear cooperation agreement, which included a deal for the American company Westinghouse to supply nuclear fuel to Hungary's Paks nuclear plant.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> This deal was valued at approximately $114 million.<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup> The White House also noted that the leaders reviewed opportunities to expand economic cooperation, including Hungarian commitments to purchase American liquefied natural gas.<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-34">34</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Friendship Forged in Ideology</h2>
           <p>The warm reception in Washington was built on a long-standing ideological affinity between the two leaders.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Orbán was the first and only European Union head of government to publicly endorse Trump's presidential candidacy in 2016, and the two have maintained a close relationship ever since.<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> This relationship is rooted in a shared populist, nationalist worldview that prioritises national sovereignty and takes a hardline stance on immigration.<sup><a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup> President Trump has praised Orbán as a "great leader" and a "strong man," and has encouraged European leaders to show him more respect, particularly for being "right on immigration."<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup><br><br>For Orbán, the relationship provides a powerful source of international legitimacy.<sup><a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> Facing criticism from the European Union over democratic backsliding, corruption, and his government's proximity to Russia, the alliance with the White House reinforces his standing.<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup> The visit itself was seen by some observers as a political favour that could bolster Orbán's position domestically ahead of parliamentary elections.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> During the meeting, Orbán praised the Trump administration, stating that much of the progress in bilateral relations had been "destroyed" during the preceding Democratic administration.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup><br><br>This political alignment has been cultivated for years.<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> Orbán has become a prominent figure on the American right, and his government has fostered strong links with conservative movements in the United States, viewing Hungary as a model of conservative nationalism.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-41">41</a></sup> Since coming to power in 2010 with a two-thirds parliamentary majority, Orbán's Fidesz party has rewritten the constitution and overhauled state institutions, including the judiciary and the media, in a manner that has consolidated its power.<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-41">41</a></sup> This project is one that some veterans of Trump's first administration have studied as a potential model for asserting greater control over the American administrative state.<sup><a href="#ref-41">41</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Illiberal Model</h2>
           <p>At the core of the Hungarian leader's political project is the concept of "illiberal democracy."<sup><a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup> Orbán first articulated this ideology in a speech in 2014, where he declared his intention to build a state that, while remaining a democracy, would abandon the principles of liberal societal organisation.<sup><a href="#ref-24">24</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> He cited countries like Russia, China, and Turkey as models for a system based on a strong state and a weak opposition, with diminished checks and balances.<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup><br><br>Orbán defines his model in opposition to what he terms liberal democracy, which he argues favours multiculturalism, is pro-immigration, and sides with adaptable family models.<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup> In contrast, his vision of an illiberal Christian democracy gives priority to Christian culture, is anti-immigration, and upholds a traditional family model.<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup> This framework has guided his government's policies, which have included cracking down on independent media, demonising migrants, and discriminating against LGBTQ people.<sup><a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup><br><br>This approach has put Hungary on a collision course with the European Union.<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup> The EU has accused Orbán of turning Hungary into an autocracy and has frozen access to funds over rule-of-law violations.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup> In response, Orbán has adopted an increasingly confrontational posture within the bloc, systematically disrupting European decision-making on key geopolitical issues.<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup> He has frequently used Hungary's veto power to delay or derail EU-wide efforts, most notably in relation to sanctions against Russia and financial aid for Ukraine.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> This has led critics to label him as the Kremlin's "Trojan horse" within the EU.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Shadow of the Kremlin</h2>
           <p>The war in Ukraine was a central topic of the White House meeting.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Both leaders expressed their belief that the conflict could end in the "not-too-distant future."<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup> Orbán has consistently positioned himself as a proponent of peace, a stance that often aligns with Russian talking points and diverges sharply from the EU consensus.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> He has refused to send military aid to Ukraine and has opposed Kyiv's bid for EU membership.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup><br><br>In Washington, Orbán sought to resurrect plans for a peace summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to be hosted in Budapest.<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> A previous attempt to organise such a meeting had been called off.<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> President Trump confirmed he remains open to meeting Putin in Hungary "when the time is right," stating that the previous summit was cancelled because he believed no progress would have been made at that time.<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup> The prospect of such a summit has been met with caution in Kyiv.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine would support any such format if it could genuinely lead to a ceasefire, but not if it was merely an "electoral fireworks show" for Orbán.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup><br><br>Hungary's relationship with Russia extends deep into the energy sector.<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> While most of Europe has worked to wean itself off Russian energy since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Hungary has deepened its dependency.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> The country increased its reliance on Russian crude oil from 64% before the invasion to 86% in 2024.<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> Budapest has also signed long-term gas supply deals with Russia's Gazprom.<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup> This continued flow of energy payments has provided significant revenue to the Kremlin's war economy.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup> Orbán's government has consistently argued that this dependency is unavoidable, a claim that some energy experts and political critics contest, suggesting the position is more about political affinity for Moscow than physical necessity.<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Divided West</h2>
           <p>The meeting in Washington highlights a significant fissure within the Western alliance.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> Orbán's actions have repeatedly undermined the EU's ability to act in unity, particularly in its foreign policy towards Russia.<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup> His government's stance has forced the EU to find ways to work around Hungary's obstructionism, such as when Orbán physically left the room during a European Council meeting to allow a decision on opening EU accession talks with Ukraine to pass.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup><br><br>The White House's embrace of Orbán stands in stark contrast to the views of many in Brussels and other European capitals.<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> It also runs counter to concerns expressed by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, who just prior to the visit introduced a resolution calling on Hungary to end its dependence on Russian energy and adhere to the EU's collective security goals.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen urged President Trump not to give Orbán a pass, noting that Hungary's actions undermine collective security and embolden the Kremlin.<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-38">38</a></sup><br><br>This divergence is reflective of the American administration's broader foreign policy, which has been described as a departure from the post-1945 rules-based international order.<sup><a href="#ref-40">40</a></sup> President Trump has frequently criticised NATO allies for failing to meet defence spending targets of 2% of GDP.<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> He has openly questioned the principle of collective defence, recalling a conversation where he told the leader of a NATO country that he would not protect them from a Russian attack if they had not paid their bills, and would even encourage Russia "to do whatever the hell they want."<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup> This transactional approach to alliances, favouring bilateral deals and prioritising an "America First" agenda, finds a natural partner in Orbán's own transactional and sovereignty-focused foreign policy.<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-36">36</a>,<a href="#ref-40">40</a></sup></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The November meeting between the American and Hungarian leaders was a clear demonstration of a growing ideological alignment that challenges the traditional foundations of the transatlantic partnership. For Hungary, the immediate prize was a crucial exemption from sanctions, securing the flow of Russian energy that fuels its economy.<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup> For the United States, it was an opportunity to engage with a like-minded leader who shares a similar scepticism of multilateral institutions and a preference for nationalist policies.<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-42">42</a></sup> The warm welcome extended to a leader who has actively worked to undermine European unity on Russia and Ukraine sends an unmistakable message to other Western allies.<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup> It signals that the White House is willing to prioritise bilateral relationships with ideological partners over the collective discipline of alliances like the EU and NATO.<sup><a href="#ref-40">40</a></sup> As this illiberal alliance deepens, it creates a powerful alternative pole of influence within the West, one that could reshape international responses to global crises and redefine the meaning of Western solidarity for years to come.</p>
