            <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>The global push for a Just Energy Transition presents Africa with a profound, two-pronged challenge: mitigating the devastating effects of climate change while simultaneously addressing a crippling energy poverty crisis that affects hundreds of millions of citizens. For nations like South Africa, the transition requires dismantling a deeply entrenched, coal-dependent economy that provides livelihoods for over a hundred thousand people, a process supported by multi-billion dollar international partnerships that nonetheless fall far short of the required investment. Across the continent, the definition of 'just' is not merely about phasing out fossil fuels, but fundamentally about achieving universal energy access and building climate resilience against impacts to which Africa has contributed minimally. Furthermore, the continent's vast reserves of critical 'green' minerals introduce a new geopolitical tension, offering an unprecedented opportunity for industrialisation if African nations can successfully move beyond exporting raw materials to controlling the entire value chain.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Weight of the Coal Economy in South Africa</h2>
           <p>The Republic of South Africa stands as the most complex case study for the continent’s energy transition, primarily due to its profound reliance on coal for power generation and economic stability<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. The country’s energy landscape is overwhelmingly dominated by coal, which accounts for approximately 73 per cent of the national energy supply<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. This dependency is not merely a technical matter of generation capacity; it is a deeply embedded socio-economic structure<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The coal value chain, encompassing mining, power generation, and petrochemicals, provides employment for over 120,000 workers<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The coal mining sector alone employed around 80,000 workers in 2020, representing a significant portion of the country’s formal employment, estimated at between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent of the total<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.<br><br>This industrial concentration is highly localised, with the Mpumalanga province serving as the epicentre of the coal economy<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. Most of the country’s coal mines, the state-owned utility Eskom’s power stations, and the coal-to-liquids plants operated by Sasol are situated within this single region<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of households are directly tied to this industry, with a significant number of these families being solely reliant on coal income<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The average coal worker often enjoys better benefits, such as retirement funds and union representation, compared to the median for other formal workers, making the prospect of job loss particularly destabilising for communities<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>.<br><br>The challenge for Pretoria is therefore not simply a matter of switching off power plants, but of managing a transition that avoids creating a new wave of mass unemployment and social dislocation in an already unequal society<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP) explicitly aims to protect vulnerable workers and communities, enhance energy security, and drive economic diversification<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. However, the sheer scale of the required transformation, which involves decommissioning and repurposing coal-fired power stations, necessitates a level of social planning and financial commitment that remains unprecedented<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Defining Justice in the African Context</h2>
           <p>The global concept of a 'Just Energy Transition' originated in the labour movement of the 1980s, focusing on securing workers’ rights and compensating communities affected by the shift away from extractive industries<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. For Africa, however, the definition of 'just' is fundamentally different and far broader than merely managing the decline of fossil fuel jobs<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. African leaders and policymakers argue that a just transition must be defined by local visions and must not impose undue costs on a continent that has contributed minimally to the climate crisis<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Africa is responsible for less than 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.<br><br>The core of the African mandate is the urgent need to address energy poverty<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Approximately 600 million people across the continent lack access to electricity, a deficit that severely hampers economic growth, health outcomes, and educational opportunities<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. In this context, a transition is only considered 'just' if it is affordable, available, and reliable enough to meet the demands of end-users, ensuring that no one is left behind<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The transition must therefore be a dual process: decarbonisation in the long term, coupled with immediate, rapid electrification for development<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. This dual imperative often leads to a strategic integration of both fossil fuels and renewables in national energy plans, a position that frequently clashes with the decarbonisation-first agenda of many developed nations<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The reliance on traditional biomass for cooking and heating by a significant portion of the population, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, further complicates the picture, leading to severe health and environmental challenges that modern energy access could alleviate<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Continental Energy Access Crisis</h2>
           <p>The energy deficit across Africa is not uniform, but it is pervasive, creating a stark divide that defines the continent’s development challenge<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. While countries like South Africa have high rates of electricity access, the majority of sub-Saharan Africa struggles with profound energy poverty<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The lack of access is most acute in rural areas, where the cost and logistical difficulty of extending the central electricity grid are often prohibitive<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. In some high-impact countries, rural electrification rates have been as low as 4 to 5 per cent<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.<br><br>However, the challenge is not confined to the countryside<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Even in urban centres, where electrification rates are generally higher, over 100 million people in sub-Saharan African cities lacked an electricity connection as of 2017, often due to prohibitively high connection costs<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Furthermore, a significant portion of urban dwellers live in slum-like conditions, where connections may be illegal, unreliable, or insufficient, characterised by frequent power outages and voltage fluctuations<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a href="#ref-23">23</a></sup>. The issue transcends a simple lack of infrastructure; it is a complex problem of affordability, reliability, and quality of supply<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The reliance on off-grid solutions, such as solar photovoltaic systems, has shown promise in hard-to-reach rural settings, but market-based approaches often fail to reach the poorest households due to high initial costs<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The lack of reliable power also extends to critical public services, with nearly half of hospitals and health centres in sub-Saharan Africa lacking reliable electricity, which compromises the storage of medicines and the operation of essential medical equipment<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Promise and Peril of International Finance</h2>
           <p>The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with South Africa, announced in 2021, was heralded as a landmark climate financing deal<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. The International Partners Group (IPG), comprising the European Union, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, initially pledged US$8.5 billion to support the country’s transition<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. This commitment later grew to US$12.5 billion with the addition of new donors<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>. The funding is intended to be 'catalytic,' leveraging a much greater level of resources from both private and public sources to meet the country’s total estimated investment need of US$98 billion (R1.5 trillion) over the initial five-year period from 2023 to 2027<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>.<br><br>Despite the headline figures, the structure of the financing has drawn significant criticism<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. The US$8.5 billion initial offer was composed primarily of concessional loans, guarantees, and blended finance, rather than outright grants<sup><a href="#ref-25">25</a>,<a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. This prioritisation of blended finance and public-private partnerships commits the South African state to ‘de-risking’ private investment, often by providing sovereign guarantees for the debt<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. Critics argue that this approach is expensive, as the state assumes the majority of the commercial risk, and that a private financing model is likely to deepen energy poverty by locking the state into high tariffs, irrespective of the falling costs of renewable energy production<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a></sup>. The reliance on debt financing risks increasing the country’s debt burden, a significant challenge for a developing economy<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>.<br><br>Furthermore, the JETP model, which has since been extended to other nations like Senegal and Vietnam, has been criticised for its supply-side focus<sup><a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>. A substantial proportion of the funds are directed towards large-scale infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy development and green hydrogen, with less emphasis on demand-side considerations like ensuring equitable access for low-income communities<sup><a href="#ref-31">31</a>,<a href="#ref-32">32</a></sup>. The social dimension, which is central to the ‘just’ mandate, has not received the same level of attention as the technical and economic aspects, raising concerns that the transition may fail to deliver equitable outcomes for all citizens<sup><a href="#ref-30">30</a>,<a href="#ref-31">31</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Geopolitics of Green Minerals</h2>
           <p>The global energy transition has inadvertently created a new geopolitical dynamic for Africa through the soaring demand for critical ‘green’ minerals<sup><a href="#ref-33">33</a></sup>. The continent holds an estimated 30 per cent of the world’s mineral reserves, including vast deposits of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite, all essential components for batteries, electric vehicles, and renewable energy technologies<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a>,<a href="#ref-35">35</a></sup>. The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for these key inputs will increase significantly by 2040, positioning Africa at a pivotal moment to shape its economic future<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a>,<a href="#ref-36">36</a></sup>.<br><br>This mineral wealth presents an unprecedented opportunity for African nations to leverage global demand for their own developmental agenda<sup><a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup>. However, it also carries the significant risk of perpetuating the historical ‘resource curse,’ where African countries remain mere exporters of raw materials while others profit from the higher-value stages of the supply chain<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a>,<a href="#ref-38">38</a></sup>. The current geopolitical competition for access to these minerals is intensifying, with global powers negotiating bilateral agreements that are often opaque<sup><a href="#ref-39">39</a>,<a href="#ref-40">40</a></sup>.<br><br>To counter this, African governments are increasingly pushing for ‘beneficiation’—the domestic processing and manufacturing of minerals to add local value<sup><a href="#ref-34">34</a>,<a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup>. Countries such as Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Namibia have imposed measures, including export restrictions, to promote domestic value addition<sup><a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup>. Furthermore, regional cooperation is emerging, exemplified by the partnership between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to produce battery precursors<sup><a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup>. The success of this strategy hinges on African states strengthening their bargaining position through greater intra-African coordination and implementing comprehensive governance frameworks, such as the African Green Minerals Strategy, to ensure that the mineral boom translates into sustainable growth and social equity<sup><a href="#ref-37">37</a>,<a href="#ref-38">38</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The energy transition in Africa is a crucible where the global climate imperative meets the continent’s urgent development needs. The challenge is not simply to decarbonise, but to industrialise and electrify simultaneously, a task that requires a fundamental re-evaluation of global climate finance<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a>,<a href="#ref-41">41</a></sup>. The current adaptation costs for sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to be between US$30 billion and US$50 billion annually over the next decade, yet the continent receives only a fraction of the necessary global climate finance<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-42">42</a></sup>. The financial mechanisms currently in place, such as the South African JETP, rely heavily on debt and blended finance, which risks exacerbating economic vulnerabilities and failing to address the social equity component of the transition<sup><a href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. The path forward demands a shift from a model of conditional aid to one of genuine partnership, recognising that Africa’s climate resilience is a precondition for sustained global economic progress<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The continent’s vast renewable energy potential and its critical mineral reserves offer a clear route to a green industrial future, but this potential can only be realised if African nations are empowered to control the value chains and define the terms of their own development, ensuring that the transition is truly just, equitable, and sovereign<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-37">37</a></sup>.</p>
