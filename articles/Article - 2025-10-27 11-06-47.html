            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>Argentina’s libertarian President, Javier Milei, secured a decisive victory in the October 2025 legislative midterm elections, a result widely interpreted as a crucial vote of confidence in his aggressive austerity programme. The win significantly bolsters the legislative power of his La Libertad Avanza party, providing the necessary political shield to continue his free-market reforms and prevent opposition from overturning presidential vetoes. The outcome was immediately celebrated by international allies, particularly the United States, which had recently conditioned a substantial financial aid package on a favourable result for the incumbent government.</p>

           <h2>A Referendum on Radical Austerity</h2>
           <p>The legislative elections held on Sunday, 26 October 2025, became a de facto national referendum on the first two years of President Javier Milei’s self-described anarcho-capitalist administration<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. His party, La Libertad Avanza (LLA), secured a sweeping victory, winning nearly 41 per cent of the nationwide vote for the Chamber of Deputies, significantly exceeding analysts’ projections<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The main opposition, the left-leaning Peronist coalition Fuerza Patria, trailed with approximately 32 per cent of the vote, marking one of the alliance’s poorest performances in years<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The election renewed 127 of the 257 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 24 of the 72 seats in the Senate<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The result was a remarkable turnaround for the government, which had suffered a heavy defeat in the Buenos Aires provincial elections just a month prior, an outcome that had sparked a market sell-off and raised doubts about the president’s popular support<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Milei’s campaign had centred on his signature policy of “chainsaw” austerity, a programme of deep public spending cuts, deregulation, and a reduction in the number of government ministries from 20 to nine<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. These measures were credited with achieving Argentina’s first fiscal surplus in 14 years and dramatically reducing the annual inflation rate from nearly 300 per cent at the start of his term to around 32 per cent<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. However, the economic overhaul has also led to a sharp decline in purchasing power, the loss of over 250,000 jobs, and the closure of an estimated 18,000 businesses, creating a polarised electorate divided by the immediate pain of the cuts and the promise of long-term stability<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Legislative Shield</h2>
           <p>The primary objective of the LLA in the midterm contest was to secure a legislative shield against the opposition’s attempts to block the reform agenda<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The Argentine Congress is bicameral, and overturning a presidential veto requires a two-thirds majority in both the 257-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 72-seat Senate<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Before the election, LLA held a small minority, with only 37 deputies and six senators, forcing the president to rely heavily on executive decrees and facing multiple successful veto overrides by the opposition in the preceding months<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The election results significantly strengthened the government’s position, with LLA gaining 64 new seats in the lower house, bringing its total representation to approximately 101 deputies<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. In the Senate, the party picked up 14 seats, increasing its total to 20 members<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. Crucially, the gains in the Chamber of Deputies are sufficient to secure the one-third threshold needed to sustain presidential vetoes, effectively preventing the opposition from unilaterally nullifying the executive’s legislative decisions<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. This new parliamentary strength is expected to clear the way for the second phase of Milei’s structural adjustment reforms, including ambitious changes to labour and tax laws<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. Speaking to supporters in Buenos Aires, a triumphant Milei hailed the result as a “turning point” and a confirmation of the mandate his party received in 2023, pledging to continue on the “reformist path”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. He also adopted a more conciliatory tone towards non-Peronist opposition parties, inviting them to negotiate on a basic set of agreements, while pointedly excluding the Peronist movement, which he referred to as “misfits”<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Washington Connection</h2>
           <p>The election was watched with unusual intensity in Washington and on Wall Street, largely due to the explicit financial intervention and political support from the United States government<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. US President Donald Trump, a close ideological ally of Milei, had publicly conditioned a substantial financial aid package on a favourable outcome for the LLA<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. In the weeks leading up to the vote, the US Treasury had finalised a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina and directly purchased Argentine pesos to stabilise the currency, which had been under pressure following the September provincial election loss<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. This was part of an unprecedented financial rescue package that included a promise of an additional $20 billion in private-sector financing<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Following the LLA’s victory, President Trump offered immediate congratulations, calling the result a “landslide victory” and stating that the confidence placed in Milei had been “justified by the People of Argentina”<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the financial assistance as part of a new “economic Monroe Doctrine,” arguing that it was better to use American economic power to stabilise a friendly government<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The opposition, however, seized on the US intervention as a rallying point, with Peronist Governor Axel Kicillof criticising the aid as a self-serving move by non-charitable entities like the US government and JP Morgan, who were only interested in profit<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The controversy surrounding the US involvement led to the hashtag #PatriaOColonia, meaning “motherland or colony,” circulating online in the lead-up to the vote<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Market Euphoria and Future Challenges</h2>
           <p>Financial markets reacted with immediate and pronounced enthusiasm to the election results, reversing the volatility and sell-off that had characterised the preceding weeks<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Argentine stocks and US-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the country rose sharply, with some Argentine stocks jumping by over 30 per cent in US premarket trading<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. The peso also extended its gains in the crypto market, strengthening to around 1,390 pesos per US dollar<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The market rally reflected investor relief that the political risk to Milei’s reform agenda had been significantly reduced, ensuring the continuation of his deregulatory and budget-cutting policies<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The victory also cemented the government’s plans to keep Argentina firmly within the orbit of the US, which had conditioned its financial support on the outcome<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. Despite the market euphoria, the government still faces immense economic and political challenges<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. While the legislative gains provide a crucial defensive position against opposition bills and veto overrides, LLA still does not command an outright majority in either chamber, meaning the president must still negotiate with provincial governors and other political blocs to pass major legislation<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Furthermore, the social cost of the austerity programme remains a significant domestic pressure point, with many Argentines continuing to struggle with plummeting purchasing power and job losses<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The success of the next phase of reforms, which includes ambitious tax and labour law changes, will depend on the government’s ability to translate its electoral mandate into effective legislative consensus and tangible economic relief for the population<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The midterm election victory for Javier Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party represents a profound political endorsement of his radical economic vision, providing him with the necessary legislative leverage to push forward his agenda<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. By securing the one-third threshold in the Chamber of Deputies, the government has gained a critical shield against the opposition’s attempts to derail his austerity programme through veto overrides<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The result was a clear rejection of the Peronist opposition and a signal from a significant portion of the electorate that they are willing to endure the current economic hardship for the promise of long-term stability<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The victory also solidifies the close political and financial alliance with the United States, which had made its substantial aid package contingent on the election’s outcome<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. As the government prepares to introduce its next wave of reforms, the challenge shifts from winning a mandate to successfully navigating a still-divided Congress and delivering on the economic recovery that the markets and his supporters now expect<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>.</p>
