            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A high-stakes meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump at the White House on 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> centred on Kyiv's urgent request for long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The request, intended to provide Ukraine with the deep-strike capability necessary to compel Russia into serious peace negotiations<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, was met with hesitation from the American leader<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. This reluctance was framed by Mr Trump's recent, lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup> and the subsequent announcement of a planned US-Russia summit in Budapest, Hungary<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The diplomatic flurry placed the future of US military aid and the trajectory of the war in Ukraine under a cloud of uncertainty<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The White House and the Long-Range Appeal</h2>
           <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Washington on 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> for his sixth in-person meeting with President Donald Trump since the latter’s return to office<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The Ukrainian leader, who wore a military-style jacket for the occasion<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>, was greeted by Mr Trump, who complimented his attire, calling him a “very strong leader”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. The primary objective of the visit was to secure a commitment for the transfer of Tomahawk cruise missiles, a weapon system Kyiv views as essential to shifting the strategic balance of the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.<br><br>During the public portion of the meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, Mr Zelensky made his case directly, stating that Ukraine needed the powerful American missiles<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. He argued that possessing the Tomahawks would serve as “additional pressure on Putin to sit down and talk,” even if the weapons were not immediately used<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Ukrainian officials had been lobbying Washington for the missiles for weeks<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, believing the long-range capability would increase the economic and military costs of Moscow’s war<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The Ukrainian President also used the opportunity to congratulate Mr Trump on the “successful ceasefire” that the US President had brokered in the Middle East the previous week<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.<br><br>Mr Trump, however, signalled a clear reluctance to approve the transfer of the long-range weapons<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. He repeatedly stressed the importance of the US maintaining its own stockpile, stating, “We want Tomahawks, also. We don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>. He described the Tomahawk as a “big deal”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup> and suggested that supplying them could be a “major escalation” in the conflict<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The US President’s overriding theme was his hope for a swift diplomatic resolution, telling reporters, “Hopefully, we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. This doubtful tone marked a shift from Mr Trump’s rhetoric earlier in the week, when he had suggested he was seriously weighing the option of sending the missiles<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Calculus of Escalation</h2>
           <p>The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) is a precision-guided, long-range cruise missile<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup> that has been a cornerstone of US deep-strike capability since its first combat use in 1991<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Modern conventional variants, such as the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk (TACTOM)<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>, have a range of approximately 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles)<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The longest-range variant, the nuclear-capable Block II, which entered service in 1983<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, had a range of up to 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles)<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The missile flies at a low altitude, around 30 to 90 metres (100 to 300 feet)<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>, at a speed of 885 kilometres (550 miles) per hour<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>, making it difficult for air defence systems to detect<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. The Block IV version is particularly advanced, featuring a data link that allows it to loiter for hours and switch targets instantly while in flight<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>.<br><br>For Ukraine, the acquisition of Tomahawks would represent a dramatic expansion of its long-range strike capabilities<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. While Ukraine has developed its own long-range weapons, such as the Flamingo missile, which reportedly has a range of over 1,609 kilometres (1,000 miles)<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, and has received Western-supplied systems like the US-made Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) with a maximum range of 306 kilometres (190 miles)<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, the Tomahawk offers a proven, high-volume, precision-strike option<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The Institute for the Study of War estimated that hundreds of Russian military targets, including logistics hubs, airfields, and command centres deep inside Russian territory, would be brought within range<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.<br><br>However, the Tomahawk system presents logistical challenges for Kyiv. The missiles are typically launched from naval vessels or submarines<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>, which Ukraine does not possess<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. A land-launched variant, the Typhon, is available, but the US Army is known to have only two launchers, and the systems are in short supply<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Furthermore, the estimated cost of each missile is approximately $1.3 million (£1 million)<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The strategic value, in Kyiv’s view, was not just the ability to strike, but the leverage it would provide in negotiations, forcing Moscow to consider the vulnerability of its rear-echelon assets<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Shadow of Budapest</h2>
           <p>The atmosphere of the White House meeting was heavily influenced by a diplomatic development that had unfolded just one day prior<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. On 16 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, President Trump held a “long call”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which lasted for two-and-a-half hours<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Following the conversation, Mr Trump announced on his Truth Social network that he and Mr Putin would soon meet in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss an end to the war<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The US President described the call as “productive”<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> and stated that he believed “great progress was made”<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. He later suggested the summit would take place “within two weeks or so”<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. The choice of Budapest was jointly made with Mr Putin, with Mr Trump citing a shared respect for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Hungary’s government had already made clear it would not arrest Mr Putin, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC)<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>.<br><br>The timing of the announcement, coming just hours before Mr Zelensky’s arrival in Washington<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>, was viewed by many in Kyiv as a deliberate attempt by the Kremlin to derail the Ukrainian President’s mission to secure advanced weaponry<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. During the call, Mr Putin directly raised the matter of the Tomahawk missiles<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, urging Mr Trump not to supply them<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The Russian leader warned that such a move would not change the situation on the battlefield but would cause “significant harm to relations” between Russia and the US<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. Mr Putin had previously warned on 5 October that arming Ukraine with long-range missiles capable of reaching Siberia would mark a “new stage of escalation”<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>.<br><br>Ukrainian officials offered a mixed reaction. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha attempted to put a positive spin on the development, writing on X that the mere discussion of Tomahawk missiles had already forced Mr Putin back into dialogue with America<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. However, Oleksandr Merezhko, a top Member of Parliament from Mr Zelensky’s party, suggested that Mr Putin was merely trying to lure Mr Trump into negotiations to avoid sanctions and military assistance to Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Mr Merezhko stated that Mr Putin “got scared because Trump promised to provide Tomahawks”<sup><a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. Mr Zelensky himself posted on social media hours before the meeting that the call had changed nothing, pointing to a swarm of Russian drone strikes that had hit his hometown of Kryvyi Rih overnight<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>A Proposition of Drones</h2>
           <p>In an effort to overcome Mr Trump’s stated concerns about depleting US military stockpiles<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>, President Zelensky presented a novel proposition: a technology exchange<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. He offered to provide the United States with Ukraine’s advanced, domestically produced drones in exchange for the long-range Tomahawk systems<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Mr Zelensky told reporters that the US could receive Ukraine’s “thousands of drones”<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>, adding, “We want to work together and help strengthen U.S. capability”<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.<br><br>This proposal was viewed by foreign policy experts as a “smart, strategic” move that leveraged Ukraine’s wartime technological edge<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The conflict has seen rapid advancements in unmanned systems, with Ukraine becoming a global leader in drone innovation and production<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The Ukrainian-made Flamingo missile, for instance, was described by Mr Zelensky as his country’s most successful weapon<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The US President responded positively to the idea, calling it “interesting”<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup> and confirming that US officials were examining Ukrainian drone technology<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Mr Trump acknowledged that Ukraine makes a “very good drone”<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> and noted that drone warfare had “really come to the fore” because of the war<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.<br><br>Beyond the Tomahawk-for-drone proposal, the two leaders discussed other critical areas of military and economic cooperation<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Mr Zelensky was expected to press for increased long-range weapons, targeting assistance, and intelligence sharing<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. He also met with US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and American energy companies to discuss expanding US access to European gas markets by storing American liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Ukrainian facilities<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. This focus on energy security underscored Kyiv’s need to reinforce its own power grid against Russian strikes<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Domestic Political Tightrope</h2>
           <p>Mr Trump’s shifting position on the Tomahawk missiles reflected the complex domestic and international pressures surrounding US aid to Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. His initial openness to the idea, which included a warning to Mr Putin that he might send the missiles if the war was not settled<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>, was quickly tempered by the Russian President’s direct intervention<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. The US President’s primary concern, as stated, was the depletion of the US military’s own inventory<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. This concern is rooted in the broader strategic assessment of US readiness for potential future conflicts<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>.<br><br>Mr Trump’s diplomatic approach, which prioritises a negotiated end to the war, has created a pattern of engagement with Mr Putin that has repeatedly raised concerns in Kyiv<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. The announcement of the Budapest summit, which would be the second meeting between the two leaders since 2022<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>, was seen by critics as a move that could be exploited by Russia to buy time and deflect pressure<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Mr Trump, however, framed himself as a mediator<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>, expressing confidence that he could persuade Mr Putin to end the invasion he launched in 2022<sup><a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. He told reporters that he thought both Mr Zelensky and Mr Putin wanted the war to end<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.<br><br>Despite the US President’s focus on diplomacy, the US has continued to provide military support to Ukraine over the last four years<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. Mr Trump’s administration has also previously supported the idea that Ukraine, with European backing, could reclaim all Russian-occupied territories<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The political dynamic in Washington remains a tightrope walk, balancing the desire to end the conflict quickly with the strategic imperative of supporting an ally against Russian aggression<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The final decision on the Tomahawk transfer, which Mr Trump said was still ‘under discussion’<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>, will serve as a critical indicator of the administration’s commitment to Kyiv’s long-term military objectives versus its immediate diplomatic goals.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The White House meeting on 17 October 2025<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup> concluded without a definitive commitment on the Tomahawk missiles<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>, leaving Kyiv’s hopes for a major boost in deep-strike capability in limbo<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. President Trump’s hesitation, driven by concerns over US military readiness and the potential for escalation<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>, was clearly amplified by his recent, lengthy conversation with President Putin<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The announcement of the Budapest summit<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup> has effectively shifted the immediate focus from military aid to high-level diplomacy, a move that has been met with both cautious optimism and deep suspicion in Ukraine<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>. While the proposed drone-for-missile exchange offers a potential path forward for a new model of US-Ukraine military-industrial cooperation<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>, the immediate future of the conflict now rests on the uncertain prospects of a negotiated settlement brokered by the US President<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The coming weeks, leading up to the planned summit in Hungary<sup><a href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>, will determine whether Mr Trump’s diplomatic push can genuinely accelerate an end to the war or if it will merely provide Moscow with a strategic pause<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a></sup>.</p>
