            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>In the pre-dawn hours of October 20, 2025, a Boeing 747-400 cargo jet arriving from Dubai skidded violently off the north runway at Hong Kong International Airport, colliding with a ground service vehicle and plunging into the sea. The catastrophic runway excursion resulted in the deaths of two airport ground staff, marking the financial hub's deadliest airport incident in over a quarter of a century. The subsequent investigation focuses on the sudden, unexplained deviation of the aircraft from its landing path, despite clear weather and optimal runway conditions.</p>

           <h2>A Routine Arrival Turns Catastrophic</h2>
           <p>The incident unfolded in the early hours of Monday, October 20, 2025, at one of the world’s busiest air cargo hubs, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA)<sup><a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Emirates SkyCargo Flight EK9788, a Boeing 747-481(BDSF) freighter, was completing its journey from Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The aircraft, registered as TC-ACF, was operated by the Turkish carrier Air ACT under a wet-lease agreement with Emirates SkyCargo<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The flight was scheduled to land on the north runway, designated 07R<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>. At approximately 3:53 a.m. local time, the jumbo jet touched down<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.<br><br>Initial flight data and official statements indicate that the landing was proceeding without any reported issues<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Air traffic control personnel had directed the flight to the north runway and did not receive any distress call or request for assistance from the flight crew<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. However, midway through its landing roll, the aircraft suddenly and abruptly veered left<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. This deviation from the normal path of travel was unexpected and immediate<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The massive freighter failed to stop within the confines of the runway, crashing through the perimeter fence and continuing its trajectory toward the sea<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The aircraft’s speed upon impact with the water was estimated to be around 49 knots<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The force of the impact caused the fuselage to break into two major sections, with the nose and cockpit coming to rest partially submerged near the coastal breakwater<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The tail section was observed to have separated from the main body of the aircraft<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Collision and Fatalities on the Ground</h2>
           <p>The runway excursion had immediate and tragic consequences on the ground. As the Boeing 747 veered off the tarmac, it struck a ground service vehicle, variously described as a security patrol car or an airfield patrol vehicle<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The vehicle was not on the runway itself but was operating in its designated area along a road outside the runway fence<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations at Airport Authority Hong Kong, confirmed that the patrol car was in its usual area and “definitely didn’t rush onto the runway”<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The aircraft’s impact with the vehicle was severe, reportedly ripping off one of the vehicle’s wheels and causing substantial damage<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The collision shunted the vehicle and its two occupants into the sea<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.<br><br>Two male ground staff members were in the vehicle at the time of the collision<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Both men were ejected into the water<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Fire Services Department (HKFSD) and Marine Police immediately launched a large-scale search and rescue operation, deploying 213 firefighters and paramedics, 45 firefighting vehicles, and multiple vessels and helicopters<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. Rescue divers recovered the two men from the sea around 5 a.m.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. One of the victims, a man aged 30, was confirmed dead at the scene at 5:55 a.m.<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The second victim, a man aged 41, was transported unconscious to North Lantau Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:26 a.m.<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The two fatalities marked the deadliest incident at the airport since it commenced operations in 1998<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.<br><br>In contrast, the four crew members aboard the Boeing 747 freighter were all rescued and confirmed to be safe, having evacuated the aircraft using an emergency slide<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Emirates confirmed in a statement that the crew were safe and that the aircraft was not carrying any cargo at the time of the crash<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Focus of the Investigation</h2>
           <p>The Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) of Hong Kong immediately classified the event as an accident and launched a full investigation to determine the cause of the deadly excursion<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The investigation is comprehensive, looking into multiple factors including the aircraft’s system, its operation, and its maintenance<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. A critical early step in the process is the recovery and analysis of the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, which are expected to provide crucial insight into the crew’s actions and the aircraft’s performance in the moments leading up to the crash<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>.<br><br>Initial statements from airport officials have narrowed the focus by ruling out several common factors in aviation accidents. Steven Yiu confirmed that the weather conditions at the time of the landing were suitable, and the runway conditions were safe, meeting all operational requirements<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The wind speed was reported as 4 knots, with gusts up to 21 knots, which is well within safe operating limits<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The absence of a distress call from the flight crew is also a significant data point for investigators<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The investigation will therefore concentrate on why the aircraft, which was 32 years old and had previously served as a passenger plane before being converted to a freighter, suddenly veered left after touchdown<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The aircraft was first delivered to All Nippon Airways in June 1993<sup><a href="#ref-5">5</a></sup>. The police have also stated that they will not rule out launching a criminal investigation into the circumstances of the crash<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The Civil Aviation Department (CAD) confirmed that air traffic controllers immediately notified rescue units once the plane deviated from its route<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>Operational Impact and Safety Record</h2>
           <p>The accident forced the immediate closure of the north runway, a vital artery for HKIA, which is a major global cargo hub<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The airport authority, however, was able to maintain operations by utilising the south and central runways<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The incident resulted in the cancellation of twelve cargo flights throughout the day, but passenger flights were largely unaffected, with only six flights experiencing minor delays ranging from five to fifteen minutes<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-5">5</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The north runway remained closed pending safety inspections and the complex recovery of the partially submerged Boeing 747<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>.<br><br>The incident is a rare and serious breach of the airport’s strong safety record<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. Hong Kong International Airport, which opened in 1998, has generally maintained a high standard of operational safety<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. The crash is considered the most serious incident at the facility in more than 25 years<sup><a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The event has prompted a review of ground coordination and landing safety protocols at the airport<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The Air Accident Investigation Authority is receiving support from Turkish and Emirati aviation authorities as part of the international investigation<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The focus remains on a thorough, objective analysis to prevent any recurrence of such a catastrophic runway excursion.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The tragic loss of two ground staff members following the runway excursion of Emirates SkyCargo Flight EK9788 has cast a shadow over Hong Kong International Airport’s operational history<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The immediate closure of the north runway and the complex marine recovery operation underscore the severity of the accident<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a></sup>. With initial reports confirming optimal weather and runway conditions, the investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Authority is now centred on the sudden, unexplained leftward deviation of the Boeing 747 freighter during its landing roll<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The recovery of the flight recorders is paramount to understanding the sequence of events that led to the collision with the patrol vehicle and the subsequent plunge into the sea, providing the necessary data to address the significant safety questions raised by this rare and fatal incident<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>
