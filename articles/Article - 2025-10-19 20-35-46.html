            <h2>Abstract</h2>
           <p>A fragile, US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas faced its most severe test on 19 October 2025, following a deadly exchange of fire in the southern Gaza Strip<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. Israel launched a wave of retaliatory airstrikes after two of its soldiers were killed in an attack it attributed to Hamas<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The escalation prompted a temporary halt to humanitarian aid deliveries into the territory and raised immediate fears that the truce, which had been in effect for less than two weeks, was on the verge of collapse<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Both sides traded accusations of violating the agreement, with Israel later announcing it would resume enforcement of the truce<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>.</p>

           <h2>The Fragile Architecture of the Truce</h2>
           <p>The ceasefire agreement, which came into effect on 10 October 2025, was the culmination of extensive negotiations mediated primarily by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. It was intended to halt two years of devastating conflict in the Gaza Strip<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The deal was based on a phased plan presented by US President Donald Trump<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>. The first phase of the agreement mandated the release of all remaining living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-14">14</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. Crucially, the agreement also required the Israeli military to withdraw its forces to a pre-designated boundary within the Gaza Strip, often referred to as the 'yellow line'<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The truce also included provisions for a significant increase in the flow of humanitarian aid into the enclave, where hundreds of thousands of people were facing severe food insecurity<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. Israel was committed to allowing 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every day<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. However, even before the major escalation on 19 October, the ceasefire had been under strain<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Israel had accused Hamas of failing to return the remains of all deceased hostages as required by the initial phase of the deal<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. In response to this perceived failure, Israel had already halved the amount of aid permitted to enter Gaza<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Furthermore, the Rafah border crossing, a vital access point not exclusively controlled by Israel, remained closed, having been largely shut since May 2024<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Hamas, for its part, had accused Israel of numerous violations since the truce began on 10 October<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The Palestinian group claimed that Israeli forces had killed 46 Palestinians and wounded 132 others in the nine days leading up to the major clash<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. These alleged violations included direct gunfire against civilians and deliberate shelling<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The Gaza civil defence agency reported that 11 members of a single Palestinian family were killed on 17 October when their bus was attacked for allegedly crossing the 'yellow line' in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City<sup><a href="#ref-6">6</a></sup>. The mutual accusations of non-compliance had created a volatile environment, making the truce exceptionally fragile<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Attack on Israeli Troops</h2>
           <p>The precarious calm was shattered on the morning of Sunday, 19 October 2025, when Israeli forces operating in the southern Gaza Strip came under attack<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The Israeli military, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), stated that militants had opened fire on its troops in the Rafah area<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The attack was described as involving both gunfire and an anti-tank missile<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. The incident resulted in the first Israeli fatalities since the ceasefire took effect<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The IDF confirmed that two soldiers were killed in the combat<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The fallen soldiers were identified as Major Yaniv Kula, a 26-year-old company commander in the Nahal Brigade’s 932nd Battalion, and Staff Sergeant Itay Yavetz, 21, who served in the brigade’s Erez programme<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Both men were residents of the central city of Modiin<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. In addition to the fatalities, three other Israeli soldiers were wounded in the same incident<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The Israeli government immediately condemned the attack as a “blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement”<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by sending his “deepest condolences” to the families of the slain soldiers<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. He also issued a directive to the military to take “strong action” against any ceasefire violations<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The attack occurred in the area of Rafah, a city that had been a major focus of Israeli military operations and was a critical point of contention regarding the agreed-upon ceasefire lines<sup><a href="#ref-18">18</a></sup>. Hamas’s armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, issued a statement following the incident, asserting its continued commitment to the ceasefire agreement across all areas of the Gaza Strip<sup><a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. The group claimed it was unaware of any clashes in Rafah and stated it had not been in contact with its units in that area since March<sup><a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13">13</a></sup>. This denial of responsibility further complicated the situation, creating a dispute over the source and nature of the breach<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>The Retaliatory Strikes and Humanitarian Fallout</h2>
           <p>Following the attack that killed the two soldiers, the Israeli military launched a swift and powerful response<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The IDF initiated a “massive and extensive wave of strikes” against dozens of what it termed Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The retaliatory strikes involved both airstrikes and artillery fire<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Targets were reported in multiple locations, including the southern city of Rafah, the northern area of Beit Lahia, and the central areas of Khan Younis and Bureij<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The military stated that the strikes were aimed at dismantling tunnels and eliminating threats, and were a direct response to the ceasefire violation<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The intensity of the bombardment quickly led to a significant number of Palestinian casualties<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. Gaza’s civil defence agency, which operates under Hamas authority, initially reported that at least 21 people had been killed in the Israeli airstrikes on Sunday, later updating the toll to at least 33<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. Other reports from health officials cited at least 11<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup> or at least 19<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup> Palestinians killed in the central and southern parts of the enclave. The casualties included civilians, with reports of entire families among the dead in Khan Younis and a strike on a coffeehouse in Zawaida town killing six people<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. The escalation immediately impacted the already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. An Israeli security official announced that the transfer of aid into the territory was halted “until further notice”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. This decision came just over a week after the US-brokered truce had begun<sup><a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The halt in aid deliveries, which had been entering Gaza from Israel, was a direct consequence of the government’s accusation that Hamas had violated the ceasefire agreement<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The closure of the crossing points to aid convoys was a significant blow to the relief effort, which was already struggling to meet the extreme need for food, medicine, and shelter in the war-torn enclave<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The United Nations World Food Programme had previously noted that the average daily food entry of 560 metric tonnes was still well below the required scale of need<sup><a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>De-escalation and Diplomatic Pressure</h2>
           <p>The sudden and violent flare-up on 19 October immediately triggered intense diplomatic activity<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. A senior Egyptian official, who was involved in the ceasefire negotiations, confirmed that “round-the-clock” contacts were underway to de-escalate the situation<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. The United States, the primary broker of the truce, was also actively engaged in efforts to hold the ceasefire together<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. American officials, including US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and former presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, were reported to have coordinated with Israeli officials, including Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The American envoys urged Israel to “respond proportionately but show restraint,” according to a US official, reflecting the international desire to prevent a full-scale return to war<sup><a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. Despite the ferocity of the retaliatory strikes, the Israeli government indicated that it did not wish to see the complete collapse of the ceasefire<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s decision to order “strong action” was framed as a response to a violation, rather than a declaration of renewed war<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. A security official told Channel 12 that Israel’s position was a “straightforward equation of a violation and a response,” and that the country did not want to bring about the collapse of the truce<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. Late on Sunday, the Israeli military announced that it had begun the “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire”<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a></sup>. The IDF statement confirmed that the decision was made “in accordance with the directive of the political echelon” and followed the series of “significant strikes” carried out in response to Hamas’s violations<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. The military affirmed its commitment to upholding the agreement while warning that it would “respond forcefully to any violation”<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>. Hamas, for its part, continued to stress its commitment to the ceasefire agreement, urging mediators and guarantors to compel Israel to respect the deal<sup><a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The group’s negotiators had arrived in Cairo to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire, which was expected to address thornier issues such as disarmament and Gaza’s postwar governance<sup><a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. The events of the day underscored the extreme volatility of the situation<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The area between the ‘yellow line’ and the Egyptian border was identified by an Israeli security official as a “hotspot for potential escalation,” where Hamas operatives were believed to be hiding in underground tunnels and attempting to harass Israeli forces<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a></sup>. The brief but deadly return to open conflict served as a stark reminder that the US-brokered truce remained a deeply fragile arrangement, dependent on the moment-to-moment restraint of both parties<sup><a href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
           <p>The events of 19 October 2025 demonstrated the inherent instability of the US-brokered ceasefire, revealing the narrow margin for error in the delicate balance of the truce<sup><a href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The death of two Israeli soldiers in a Hamas-attributed attack prompted a massive Israeli military response, resulting in dozens of Palestinian casualties and the suspension of critical humanitarian aid<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-10">10</a></sup>. While Israel ultimately declared a resumption of the ceasefire’s enforcement, the day’s violence exposed the deep mistrust and competing interpretations of the agreement’s terms<sup><a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. The core challenge remains the implementation of the truce’s later phases, which require addressing complex issues such as the return of all deceased hostages, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the future governance of the Gaza Strip<sup><a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a></sup>. The diplomatic efforts of the United States, Egypt, and Qatar continue to be the primary bulwark against a full-scale return to the two-year war, but the latest escalation confirms that the peace remains profoundly conditional and vulnerable to collapse at any moment<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>.</p>
